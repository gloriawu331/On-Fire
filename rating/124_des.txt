An invitation to pleasure, 1740 was inspired by the Marquis de Sade, a Parisian aristocrat who was imprisoned many times for his libertine sexuality. 1740 is a dark and erotic fragrancean invitation to pleasure where a deep woody accord mingles with notes of bergamot, cardamom, and a rounded trail of leather, patchouli, and cedarwood. The notes of spices of leather recall a time that changed the path for many: the scandalous Century of Lights.  It is a truly unflinching scent for the modern male hedonist.Notes: Bergamot, Davana Sensualis, Patchouli, Coriander, Cardamom, Cedar, Birch, Labdanum, Leather, Vanilla, Elemi, Immortelle.Style:Dark. Mysterious. Seductive.An invitation to pleasure, 1740 was inspired by the Marquis de Sade, a Parisian aristocrat who was imprisoned many times for his libertine sexuality. 1740 is a dark and erotic fragrancean invitation to pleasure where a deep woody accord mingles with notes of bergamot, cardamom, and a rounded trail of leather, patchouli, and cedarwood.
