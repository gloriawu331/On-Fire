This serum can be used by putting a few drops on hair after shampooing or added to your conditioner . I have tried it both ways. I like the few drops massaged in to my hair before I blow dry after using the new Caviar Infinite Color Hold Shampoo. It added that extra bit of softness and manageability to my dyed auburn hair. Using the serum in the conditioner weighed my hair down but most conditioners tend to do that to me. My hair is thick but fine. I shampoo daily , blow dry and style with a curling iron so my hair takes a lot of abuse and I am confident this will help keep my hair looking bright and rich!
