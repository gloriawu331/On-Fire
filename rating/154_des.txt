What else you need to know: In 1981, Olivier Baussan, founder of L'Occitane, traveled to Burkina Faso where the local women relied on shea butter and its exceptional moisturizing properties to help nourish their skin. He began working with 12 women in a cooperative to produce shea butter for L'Occitane products. More than 30 years later, L'Occitane works with more than 15,000 women in fair trade cooperatives and supports their economic emancipation with literacy and microcredit programs.
