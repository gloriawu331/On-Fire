Why haven't I heard more about these? These are amazing! They're not just a boring old lipgloss. They have beautiful colour to them. I bought this in royale and it's a beautiful purple pink colour. It's not sticky at all and feels great on the lips. I did not find it had a flavour or scent. You can use this by itself or on top of a lipstick.This stuff is so great! I purchased the color "Honest" and it is better than my natural lip color, but close enough to give you that natural beauty look. It also is seriously moisturizing without being greasy or sloppy. Stays in place and is a very pretty look. Great for summer with a tan or winter with fair skin.I have this in "honest". Bought it without seeing it on recommendation on a website. I absolutely love it and wear it every day. It is a beautiful slightly glossy brown pink nude. It is gorgeous! If you want a nude colour, get Honest!!! Totally not sticky, I am so happy with this and all-natural on your lips is great since I'm probably eating it :))))I am a huge fan of RMS and received Moment as a gift. I love brown based nudes but they can look harsh or muddy on my light to medium skin tone. Moment is the perfect shade- brown with enough peach in it to make it wearable. It feels divine on my lips, creamy and lightweight but it has a good amount of pigment. It lives up to it's name of Lip Shine. It's shiny but not sticky and the packaging is elegant like all RMS products: the little frosted glass jar. Love this- beautiful on its own or layered over a nude lip pencil. I have already ordered Moment- the formula is that good!
