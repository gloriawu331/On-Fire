As a former makeup artist for magazines and television, I've experienced a massive variety of exquisite beauty products, and this is the best liquid liner out there. The price is justified. Every product I've tried from this line is stellar. ...And the packaging is lovely! Surratt's iridescent black containers don't get gummy like Nars' and they're sleek, so easy for travel. Hope to see more shades of this product in the future.It's the best eyeliner I've ever used and lasts for several months... Way longer than stila or kat Von d eyeliner and no dragging at all. Is more expensive upfront but lasts so much longer and the refills are so awesome. Buy this if you like a good cat eye.
