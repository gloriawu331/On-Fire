Other than the strong smell and the fact that my face is still an oil slick halfway through the day, it was a decent primer! The tint is a nice added coverage and it definitely smoothed out my complexion and made my skin look great (for the first few hours). I will have to return though because it doesn't do a good job at mattifying and that's my main concern.
