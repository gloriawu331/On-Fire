I love this cream. I have very dry skin and I rarely get breakouts. This cream is rich and perfect for my type of skin. I will say that I don't use it nightly because it does whiten and brighten so I only need to use it a few times a week or I'll be too white. A few times a week and it works wonders!Do not use if you are acne prone. It contains petroleum amongst other oils which together have an even larger possibility of clogging pores. I do love other SK-II creams and use them exclusively.I've used many of the SK-II products so I decided to try this one after using the Ultimate Revival Cream. The thing I didn't like about this was that it felt more like a lotion and it didn't blend into my skin as nicely. It was almost too moisturizing. I also didn't really notice as much of a brightening effect as I did with the other products. It's a decent product but for the price I wouldn't buy it again. I'm not as big a fan of the texture. But SK-II doesn't make any bad products.Maybe this good for others but not me. I have combination skin and this cream made my skin terrible.I get zitsI was using the Essential cream and it wasn't moisturizing enough so I thought that this would bridge the gap at night.
 It is a solid that you scoop a little out and warm it up in your hands. Then press your palms onto your face. Press, press press. It feels great too. Very plush. I would continue to use it but I cannot justify the expense when there are other products that work just as well for a fraction of the price. If it worked miracles, great, but it didn't.I am not using this anymore, but anyone who is interested, you should try it anyway. I love the SK-II facial treatment essence, and got a big sample of this cream from a Duty Free purchase. Initially, I loved LOVED this cream. The texture is amazing, and it just absorbs into your skin and leaves it so hydrated and baby smooth. However, after about a week, my skin broke out, and this was the only change I had made to my routine. I stopped using the cream and the breakouts went away. My skin must not like some aspect of this, but if you don't usually break out from a rich cream, you really should try this. I am recommending it even though I couldn't continue using it. It's that good.I haven't gotten any breakouts while using this product. It hydrates my skin, lightens it, and my wrinkles are almost non-existent! I don't have to use it every day, once or twice a week as an overnight cream is sufficient for its effect. I still have a lot of product left after using it for 6 months and planning to purchase more after it's finished!I have sensitive skin and this made my skin angry.back it went after one application.I use this cream in conjunction with the Essence and my skin looks wonderful.
