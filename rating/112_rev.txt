If you need a tightening feeling before your makeup, this is it. When my skin feels dull, and puffy/saggy by the jawline and cheeks, and I feel like my wrinkles in my forehead are more pronounced I OUT this one. It literally feels like tape pulling my face back. The only thing is that I have to pat it in after any serums, & if I'm using an oil I try not to use it with this, or if I need to, I put the oil on first and let it dry and then this. If you rub this too much, it can almost cause like little dry peels, that rub off. Just pat it and let it sit and feel the face lift magic!If you need a tightening feeling before your makeup, this is it.
