So this was in a popular subscription box, Popsugar Must Have. It took me a while to get around to trying it. Living in SoCal, and having blonde colored hair, I figured this would be good for me. I was concerned about the product stating that it lasted beyond a shampoo (I read: build up). Yet, it also states you remove it with a simple shampoo. Hmm. Anyway I tried it and in thrilled! I only used a conditioning spray with this. It truly works like a light styling cream. My hair is super soft, smooth, controlled, some body, and super light! You can't feel any heavy product in my hair. It reminds me of Kerastase styling creams. Go for it!
