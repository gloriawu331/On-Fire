I've tried other products from this company and love them. I wanted something that would conceal my familial dark circles under the eyes, not make me react, and condition my skin. Found it. My patients think I am 15 years younger than I am instead of pushing 50.Smooth clear light cover the best concealer finely i found one from all around in the market i named it as the best of all i going to perches the other coolers for the season changing mixing them Thank yuo Omroviza and shefora for bring it i like to have more from this companyI normally use YSL concealer, but wanted to give this a try. Overpriced is an underestimate. The product definitely did not have a "creamy" texture. It was more slick and didn't provide good coverage. I tried using it under my foundation and over my foundation. Was not happy with either result. Not worth it for me.WOW! this concealer is a dream to use ... The silky texture provides full coverage while still feeling supremely natural & comfortable on the skin. It totally covers what you want, while somehow "melting" into your skin at the same time. The coverage lasts all day, with NO creasing, NO build-up, NO color change/oxidizing. And this creamy concealer works beautifully under my BE Mineral Powder Foundation! Inexplicably, the powder doesn't stick to this concealer at all, instead it just glides right over it, so the hormonal blemishes totally disappear (rather than being accentuated by build-up or changes in texture, and without being wiped away to nothing by the foundation brush). I had avoided using concealer under my eyes for several years because it made them look worse (dry, crepe-y, creases), but this one brightens without ever settling into my fine lines, and it leaves my delicate under-eye skin looking dewy & radiant. I use a tiny firm brush to apply the product on my spots, then tap with my fingers to blend. The Beige color works well for my medium skin (even while I'm quite tan at the moment) (and as long as I use a foundation over it; otherwise it's too light - but with foundation, it magically becomes a "perfect color match"), and it has enough yellow to block out any red from blemishes. O's concealer is a revelation, pure perfection for me :) And because it is one of the very rare concealers that has ***NO SILICONES*** , no breakouts!I use this concealer under my eye and sun-spot. It won't cake or line after covered with loose powder. I can easily dub on again on top of the loose powder to create a thicker coverage for stubborn spot. Will buy another stick when current one is finished.
