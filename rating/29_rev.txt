I am a lipstick diva. I'm constantly on the hunt for the perfect tube and hue to give me the look stellar. I usually stick to pinks, mauves, and wines occasionally being brace to wear blue red. I have a cool, fair complexion with aqua eyes so I have often thought corals, oranges, and browns were not in my pallet. I have tried every tube in this spectacular set and they all look wonderful on me! I have found if I adjust my makeup pallet for the day to compliment the specific shade of Vice Lipstick, it works very well. I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it. The colors don't bleed and stay on for hours.I love these lipsticks and if you're willing to spend a bit of extra money you get a variety of color and formula.I LOVE THIS UD VAULT! LOVE IT! IT'S EVERYTHING I LOVE ABOUT MAKEUP! COLORS GO FROM CLASSY-EDGY! LOVE UD ❤️As someone who doesn't wear lipstick very often I was hesitant to spend this kind of money on them but I'm so glad I did!! It's a great set to have a little bit of everything you'd want. I saw some reviews about the tubes not twisting up and when I received mine the first thing I did was check them all. I did notice 3 didn't want to twist up but when I pushed up while twisting they all worked perfectly fine.This is an awesome set! I was able to get it when sephora had their 20% sale going on, so each lipstick came out to $8 a piece, which you can't beat!!! I am giving this four stars because of some colors/ shades missing. It could have been a little more diverse, but all in all, this was well worth the splurge!Perfect for the avid lipstick collector. Has different shades and finishes. If you want to try something, this is the set to buy. It literally has every type of lipstick you could ask for. Only thing is if, Urban Decays lipstick formulas work for you. They do for me, but i do need extreme hydration prior.
 Love this. Thank you UrbanDecay!My boyfriend bought this box for me so that I could gift the lipsticks to friends and family and other people in my life. When I saw the colors in person they were soooo pretty!!! There's a great range of mattes metallics comfort mattes and sheers so I was definitely able to gift to different persons according to what they would wear. I wound up keeping some of the bolder colors to myself like bang bang pandemonium disturbed and conspiracy they're all beautiful I think the metalized are my favorites.. they're long wearing and moisturizing this box s set was definitely worth the money. I want to purchase more urban decay vice lipsticks they are so good! he box that the lipsticks come in have a removable tray which I will be using for storage on my vanity which is a plus. i would recommend this entire set as a perfect makeup lovers gift in its entirety.I'm super happy with the colours included in this set, all are wearable and the formulas are great. Downside: 2 of the lipsticks would not twist up, I had to mess around with the packaging for a few minutes for it to 'catch' the mechanism and then they worked. Also noticed that some of the lipsticks had quite a bit less product than others which surprised me. Overall will keep because I am obsessed with the colours but quality control doesn't seem to be that great.colors are great and good prizeThese lipsticks feel so great on my lips, I love the variety of shades and finishes this stockpile comes with. For someone who loves lipsticks and colors, this is for you.Purchased this as a gift for myself for my birthday and let me say that the value is perfect. Such beautiful colors that flatter every skin tone. Best purchase by far from Sephora. Get it before it's gone.These lipsticks are amazing totally worth the splurge!!! They offer a great color selection an amazing formula and a great addition to any Lipstick collectionFor those of you who asked whether these are minis, these are not minis. They are regular sized lipstick!! They're amazing.... worth every penny!I personally don't like the texture of the lipsticks! Will be returning ..This is totally worth the splurge, they are super pigmented and feel weightless on the lips.My first time ever loving a product so much that I wanted to review it!!! These lipsticks are amazing and long lasting. Get these with your 20% off and it's such a steal!!! Hadn't tried UD lipsticks before this but so glad I did. It definitely won't disappoint!!So I received my vice lipstick stockpile today and I am officially IN LOVE with them. I literally sat and opened every one of them to bask in their glory! 
 I believe this is a great buy for someone interested in getting the Vice Lipsticks but does not already own a majority of them. These are some of the "fan favorites" so I think if you have like 70 lipsticks, it's not a good investment.
 But for beauty lovers who have always wanted to try the urban decay lipsticks, this is a great start with colors you can mix and match. I do wish there was a bit more variety on the colors chose to go into the stockpile, since many of the shades so run in the same family they are just a hair off from each other. 
 CONSI only have two drawbacks.
 1 .A few of my lipsticks were "sweaty" when I opened them. I don't know if this came from the UPS truck or the warehouse, but just make sure you check your lipsticks before you use them.
 2. A few lipstick bullets were stuck when I tried to twist them and open them. I don't know if this shows how "new" the product is, but one lipstick I legitimately had to keep turning back and forth because it would not come out of the tube. Others were just stubborn and took some turning to get out.
 Besides those, I'd still give this product 5 stars. It's well worth it with the variety of colors and the packaging itself!I am so excited there is finally a vault for the Vice lipsticks, this value is amazing, 30 lipsticks for 325 dollars is the best deal you can get. I am in love with this lipstick line and the wide variety of colors makes it easy to complete any look. The colors are long-lasting, creamy and highly pigmented. I would recommend to anyone!Wide variety of pigmented shades!I am a lipstick diva. I'm constantly on the hunt for the perfect tube and hue to give me the look stellar.
