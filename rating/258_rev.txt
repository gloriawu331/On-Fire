This stuff is the bomb. I took a chance on it -- online only and no reviews. I've been so pleased with the decision to try it. The product protects my fair skin from the sun. It is virtually without scent. There is an innocuous color to the cream, but it disappears as I rub the product into my skin. I'll buy more as long as it is available.
