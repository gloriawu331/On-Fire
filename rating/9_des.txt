All of the Lancer Skin care treatments are formulated for optimum efficacy and luminous results.

"Apply moisturizer while skin is still dampwithin three minutes of cleansing to lock in the precious hydration sensitive skin needs. Internally, I recommend digestive enzymes and probiotics for patients with reactive skin."Dr. LancerWhich skin type is it good for?
