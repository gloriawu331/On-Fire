I don't understand why companies need to put so much perfume in products that we are putting on delicate skin . I purchased this cream , opened the jar and fell on the floor ( ok maybe that's exaggerating) I am afraid for my skin . I will returnI have sensitive skin and need to know what is in this. Am I missing it?It's my second time to purchase it...this product is AMAZING..Okay ladies, I know it's super expensive, but the thing is that it is totally worth it. My skin is getting smoother and lighter everyday. Now I don't even wear makeup and still looks fine. I don't know what they did to this stuff, but it works so well..It is an awesome product for winter. Very hydrating and it hydrates my skin immediately. Not greasy at all.I adore this cream, it's exactly what I want. It's a moisturizing cream that I can use day or night without the heaviness of other creams. Price is the downside. I use very small amounts and it works so wonderfully to hydrate my dull/tired skin. My skin looks gloomy with this product. Love it!I have been using a French line of products for years and I have been very happy. But these two dry winters in So Cal have made my skin really dry. So, I tried this cream to see if there would be a difference. My skin in 4 weeks feels like the skin I had in my 20's!!! If you have sensitive combination skin, give this a try!!! You won't regret it!!i know 146$ may seem crazy for a face cream, but this one is worrth it! i have normal/dry skin and i've tried so many face creams but they all didnt seem to help or work as much as this one does! first 3 days using this ive noticed my skin is more radiant, softer, supple, and just the overall appearnce while using this i now have a healthier glow to my skin.you may wana just bite the bullet on this one, so worth it:)I don't understand why companies need to put so much perfume in products that we are putting on delicate skin .
