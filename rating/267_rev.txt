I love the color of the lip gloss and the way it looks, and I love the smell it's perfect for an everyday use and lasts all day!My husband loves this fragrance on me, especially when applied to warm skin (post shower). It melts into your pores and your skin breathes its luxurious aroma for 7-8 hours. It is that come hither stare in liquid form. Sillage is moderate, but performs best in cooler temperatures. So nice during the fall season.
