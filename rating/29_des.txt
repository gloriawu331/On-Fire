 Urban Decay Vice Lipstick Stockpile has your fix, all in one set. Introducing Vice Lipstick Stockpile, a fully loaded, limited-edition set featuring a wide array of 30 creamy, addictive shades of Vice Lipstickfrom bold brights and dark, sexy shades to super-versatile neutrals. With such a wide array of colors and six different finishes (mega matte, comfort matte, cream, metallized, sheer, and sheer shimmer), you’ll never run out of options. From Disturbed, an ultra-dark brick red matte, and Pandemonium, a super-matte purple, to Big Bang in bright pink sparkle, 714’s must-have red matte, and F-Bomb, a cult-favorite red cream, there’s something for everyone.

Every shade features Urban Decay’s proprietary Pigment Infusion System™, which gives Vice Lipstick its super-creamy texture, rich payout, and superior color dispersion. Just one swipe provides locked down color, and each shade applies smoothly, coats your lips, and feels amazing.

When you’re finished with all the lipsticks, just lift out the inner tray and use the case to hold the rest of your beauty stash.
