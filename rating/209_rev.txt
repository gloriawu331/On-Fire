I like these because they don't add an extra step to my skincare routine and they're really cool because they disappear when they're done working. I stick them on any breakouts before I put on my sheet mask and they dissolve by the time I remove my mask. I have already used this twice on multiple spots and they really help get rid of my acne. Also, my skin isn't red or dry after so I can put my makeup on right afterward which is a major plus. I can treat a bunch of areas at once so I think this is a pretty good deal. I want to try the one for under the eyes too.
