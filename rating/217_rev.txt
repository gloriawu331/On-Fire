If you like Ouidad's Curl Quencher line, which I do for my 2B/3A curls, you'll like this product. That said, the set I received was not what is advertised here. Instead of the Finishing Mist Setting & Holding Spray I received the Hydrafusion Intense Curling Cream. It's frustrating to spend so much on a set and not get what you want.
