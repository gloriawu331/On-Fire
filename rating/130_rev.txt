The absolute BEST setting powder. Not only is it extremely light weight, but it is so incredibly silky and smooth - it is on a different level than any other setting powder I have used!!why oh why did i waste my money on this?? its a cool container, i thought maybe it wouldn't dry me out like some powders do but i was wrong. if you're looking for a silky less expensive powder go with the makeup forever hd one. feels the same.Spendy but it works great!While I like the feel and texture of this product, the color looks nothing like the photo. It was much darker than I expected it to be based on the pictures. Pretty disappointed especially for the price.I bought this loose powder by Kevyn Aucoin because I have the skin enhance that I simply love but this product did not live up to the brand name. It says it brightens and evens the complexion with a silky finish which maybe it did… but with a powdery look that didn't seem to blend in but stood out. It just didn't do it for me so I returned it.I have tried every powder you can think of! LM setting powder or Chanel,La Mer loose and pressed powders, everything--i have tried them all and they all made me look cakey or flat. I didnt have high expectations for this powder but wanted to give it a try and I am IN LOVE. It is the best thing ever--i dont even know how it works but it just makes your face look flawless. Would have never expected to like this but i LOVE it and i feel that it has made the biggest difference and as I said i have tried them ALL. I love this stuff--will buy a backup. Worth every penny. I have both colors and use the lighter one to highlight and the darker one for everywhere else. It is the best powder ever. You will not be disappointed.The absolute BEST setting powder.
