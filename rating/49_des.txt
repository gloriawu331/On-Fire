What it is:
A limited-edition, skin-luminizing, customizable set with the iconic Original Foundation and the Beautiful Finish Brushplus an exclusive Invisible Glow Highlighter designed by Ingrid Nilsen.

What it does:
 BareMinerals teamed up with YouTube personality, Ingrid Nilsen, to create a limited-edition collection of skin-luminizers, inspired by Ingrid's personal message of letting your best self shine through. 

The collection includes a full-size Original Foundation (now available in 30 shades), plus a custom metallized Beautiful Finish Brush emblazoned with Ingrid's message "Be You" as a reminder to be your best self every day. The star of the collection is Ingrid's bespoke highlighter, which she designed exclusively in a limited-edition warm champagne shade infused with gold pearl, which makes you look as radiant as you feel. This hand-baked formula feels utterly weightless, applies smoothly and blends evenly for a luminous, natural complexion. 

The collection comes in a soft gray makeup bag adorned with Ingrid's personal mantra, be your best self, as a daily reminder to take wherever you go. 


This set contains:
- Cosmetic Bag
- 0.28 oz/ 8 g Original Foundation Broad Spectrum SPF 15 (shade of your choice)
- 0.24 oz/ 7 g Limited Edition Invisible Glow Highlighter in Resilience
- Limited Edition Be Beautiful Finish brush

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
- Sulfates

What else you need to know:
 Invisible Glow Highlighter is made by Italian artisans. This pigment packed formula begins as a cream that is baked on a terracotta tile for 24 hours, and hand-finished. The result is an ultra-lightweight powder that feels creamy upon application, and delivers pure pigment with no binders or fillers.
