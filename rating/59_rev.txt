Mascara: This is a pretty standard mascara. I can't say it outperforms others in its category. It gets a 3. 
 Liner: Some may be a fan, but trying to blur this out w/ a brush is nearly impossible. I'm not a fan of the very stark line, but others may like this aspect. 
 Glitter Topcoat: It looks SO pretty when it goes on. THEN, it dries and the effect is lost. Total disappointment.I love this set! The eyeliner is amazing! The mascara-you don't need a lot at all. And the only reason I gave 4 stars was the glitter top coat is okay. Doesn't really show that well in a dim room and makes your eyelashes a little clumpy if you use too much. Overall great price and value.Marc Jacobs eyeliner was already my favorite, so I decided to try out the mascara too and this little collection seemed like a great way to go. My go-to mascara is always Too Faced Better Than Sex but this mascara looks more natural to me and now I use them both; marc Jacobs for everyday, and Too Faced for when I want Falsies style volume. I really didn't expect to even use the glitter mascara but I'm soooooo glad that I tried it, it's not as over-the-top as I thought it would be and I love the extra sparkle that it brings to my eyes. I love this collection!!!!!I just love, love, love this mascara!Mascara: This is a pretty standard mascara. I can't say it outperforms others in its category. It gets a 3.
