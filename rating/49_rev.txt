I'm a total sucker for supporting the underdog, cause lets be real, even though Ingrid is big to us, she isn't huge when compared to a Hollywood starlet. Anyway, I got this because it is an awesome value, the bag and brush are cute and I turn 35 this year so I am totally rediscovering my skin. When I first tried Bare Minerals years ago, I didn't have YouTube as my guide (just infomercials on an old tv) so I didn't have it drilled in my head that you only need a little bit and to layer. Thus it never looked right on me. But here I am trying it out today and I LOVE it. My skin isn't oily anymore but it still has a oily looking shine but I feel like staying matte ages me. This gives me a great glow that's not too much. I got the hydrating mineral veil with it and it's awesome. The previous review is right when she (or he?) says that its a little hard to get the highlighter on the brush at first but once you do its gorgeous. It is subtle but gorgeous. Awesome job, Ingrid!The value of this is amazing! Such a great price for what you get. The brush is beautiful and so soft, the bag is a great size and this is the first time I've ever used bare minerals foundation powder and I already love it! It's a really light wonderfully soft finish and a great amount of coverage. The ONLY thing I would say is that you have to work a little harder to get the highlighter on a brush and I tried three brushes. But once you get it on it looks beautiful and has a golden tone and subtle shimmer. I'm super happy with this purchase!!!This product is what introduced me to the Bareminerals foundation! When I went to try it out I would have spent $50 for foundation and the brush separate. With this you get both, and a FREE highlight and really cute makeup bag. The brush is one of my favorite things about this kit, it's very pretty sitting on my vanity. I wasn't a fan of the highlight at first, but now I really like it for my no makeup makeup days. I love this kit!This is the best deal you can get if you use Bareminerals. You get the full size original foundation, the full brush in a beautiful silver handle, the huge high quality bag and a huge full size highlighter. If you are planning on buying the foundation anyway, you should just get this set while its still available. Just buying the foundation and the bush alone is more expensive than this set. You wont regret it!The best $50 I've ever spent! You do get a full-size Original foundation, along with a full-size brush and highlighter. The bag is super cute, too.First impression is WOW the bag is BIG. It is 9Wx6H. I was expecting something of the more usual gift bag size, like 6Wx4H. The size of this is closer to a large clutch. I cant say I care for all the room. It takes away from the chic factor IMO. I was also expecting the bag to be white, like the picture, but it is actually a 25% blue-ish grey... again, this takes away from the chic factor for me personally.
 To actually get into the products inside, the pro is that you are getting a full size brush and highlighter. I believe the foundation may be full size as well, but Im not 100% sure on that since Im not familiar with this entire line. I like the foundation, and the brush is easy to use and a beautiful rose golden kind of metal. The highlighter was unimpressive for me - it was chalky and very subtle.
 Bottom line for me is that if you like a lot of value for your buck, this is great way to try out their foundation as well as get a full size brush and highlighter while youre at it. The bag is great if you like a giant carryall type of bag.I'm a total sucker for supporting the underdog, cause lets be real, even though Ingrid is big to us, she isn't huge when compared to a Hollywood starlet.
