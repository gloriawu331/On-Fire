I have worn Orange Sanguine for a couple years. It's my go-to winter fragrance. I decided to treat myself to this hand cream. I should have returned it but have been too busy to get to my nearest Sephora. The scent lasts about five minutes on me, and it's worse than your average budget hand cream at actually hydrating my skin. It's a tiny tube, smaller than other hand creams that actually hydrate your skin, for about a fifth of the price.
