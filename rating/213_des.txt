What else you need to know:
 Invisible Bronze is made by Italian artisans, and no two are exactly alike. The pigment-packed formula begins as a cream, is baked on a terracotta tile for 24 hours, and is then hand-finished for an ultra-lightweight powder that feels creamy upon application, and delivers pure pigment and pearlwithout any binders or fillers.
