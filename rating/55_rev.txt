For several of years, I have been using false eyelashes everyday. My eyelashes are short and not so full. After using this serum for quite some time, I have been seeing such amazing results. It really works. I absolutely love this serum. I bought my first one at Dr. Lancer's Office in LA about 1.5 years ago and I just ran out. I'm so glad it's avalible at Sephora because the serum runs out of stock at Lancer quickly. It's quite expensive but really worth it.I'll admit, while curious about this product, I was also a little skeptical as I've tried others in the past. Within a few weeks I did notice my lashing getting longer - and maybe some new ones starting to fill in. Cheaper than lash extensions.For several of years, I have been using false eyelashes everyday.
