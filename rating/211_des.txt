What else you need to know:
 "People love to use bronzer as a contour! We get questions about this all the time. Color-wise, bronzers don’t work well as a contour so I combined the two. Our Contour Bronze makes for a more realistic contour shade by using brown undertones rather than the dated red-orange hues. Doubles also as a bronzer for darker skin tones. Either way you can’t lose!"Rose-Marie Swift, Founder of RMS Beauty
