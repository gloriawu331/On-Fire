What it is:
A silky, ultra-fine, baked highlighter for all skin tones, that imparts a natural-looking, multi-dimensional glow.

What it does:
 Dust on a gorgeous glow that suits your skin tone. This smooth, baked formula delivers sheer color that looks naturally radiant and never overdone. Its ultra-fine reflective pearls catch the light for a glowing look that mimics how sunlight reflects on skin. 

Choose the shade for your skin tone:
Fair-to-light skin tones: a beige and opal blend to create a glistening icy white 
Medium skin tones: a blend of pink and gold to create a glistening soft pink
Tan skin tones: a champagne and copper blend for a glistening, warm copper hue 
Dark-to-deep skin tones: bronze and coral blend for a glistening warm bronze shade

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
- Sulfates
- Phthalates

What else you need to know:
 Invisible Glow is made by Italian artisans, and no two are exactly alike. The pigment-packed formula begins as a cream, is baked on a terracotta tile for 24 hours, and hand-finished for an ultra-lightweight powder that feels creamy upon application, and delivers pure pigment and pearlwithout any binders or fillers.What it is:
