What it is:
A large, ultrasoft, natural-hair brush for creating subtle or smoldering smoky eye looks. 

What it does:
Master any smoky eye lookfrom subtle and hazy, to moody and intensewith this intuitive, Artistique Smoky Eye Brush Grande. The elongated teardrop shape is ideal for laying down a base shadow and effortlessly blending ombré color. Surratt Beauty is committed to the Japanese philosophy of monozukuri; each high-quality brush is crafted from hand-tied natural fibers by a skilled artisan.

What else you need to know:
 The Surratt Beauty line of ergonomic brushes is designed to do most of the work for you. During the first few uses, some natural hair shedding is normal and should be expected. To maintain the integrity of your brush, wash with gentle shampoo at least once a month. Reshape the natural hairs and lay flat on a towel to dry.

"The modern smoky eye is how a French girl would wear ita bit lived in, edgier, and sexier. Keep pigment tight and dense along the inner rim and upper lash line."Troy Surratt
