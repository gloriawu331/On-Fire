I love the clean scent, The balm is an excellent base on which to layer the fragrance without over-powering. It is not at all greasy, so its great in the summer humididty. Only one complaint: the packaging is definitely for a man! It is an awkwardly big screw top pot, in a very masculine style. It is difficult to get the huge lid screwed back on correctly. It looks like a military item-- NOT pretty on the vanity! I get that this is a unisex fragrance, but now I sometimes suspect that i'm coming off more masculine than I desire. Also, my husband likes the scent, but agrees that the package is obviously man-sized. So, now my husband sees my "men's fragrance" sitting on my vanity- disappointment!
