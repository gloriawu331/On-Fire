This is a beautiful shade of cool-toned dark brown. It would make a great contour color because it is not overly cool, nor is too warm at all. It is a 2-in-1 contour and bronzer shade as the name implies. Unfortunately, it is heavily loaded in bronze shimmer. You can get away with using it as a contouring-blush on the cheeks because the shimmer doesn't translate too much. However, you can't contour your nose or anywhere else with it because it looks ridiculous (like you're wearing sparkly eyeshadow on your nose). I also enjoy applying a sheer wash all over my eyelids as an eyeshadow. I really wish Rose-Marie Swift would come out with a proper (matte) contouring shade.
 One more thing- it's VERY strong, so use the tiniest dab on your finger/brush and blend it out very well, otherwise your face can look a bit bruised.
