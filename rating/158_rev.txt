I tried the sample "retexture" code and was amazed at the improvement in my skin. Also surprised that my sensitive skin reacted well. I will probably use it a bit less than suggested because a little goes a long way with me. After treating my face, I also used the pads on my hands. Instant improvement. I have since ordered the value set. I see Sephora caps us at "over 54". I'm way over. *:-)This is a really beautiful peel and serum. I love the Kate Somerville Clinic-to-Go peels and alternate those with these. The serum is gentle, yet still packs a punch. I do the peel, follow with the serum and top everything with the moisturizer, and I cannot tell you how lush my skin is in the morning. Worth every penny!
