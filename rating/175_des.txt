What it is:
 A large, natural-hair concealer brush designed to erase dark spots and imperfections. 

What it does:
 This domed brush is the ideal shape for blending under-eye concealer or hides blemishes and skin imperfections so that all you see is skin. Surratt Beauty is committed to the Japanese philosophy of monozukuri; each high-quality brush is crafted from hand-tied, natural fibers by a skilled artisan.

What else you need to know:
 The Surratt Beauty line of ergonomic brushes is designed to do most of the work for you. During the first few uses, some natural bristle shedding is normal and should be expected.  To maintain the integrity of your brush, wash with gentle shampoo at least once a month. Reshape the natural hairs and lay flat on a towel to dry.
"Use the curved brush in the tear trough area to eliminate redness and darkness."Â—Troy Surratt
