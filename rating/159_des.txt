What it is:An FDA-cleared laser available for at-home use that delivers permanent results for unwanted body and face hair, designed to work on fair to medium skin tones with contrasting light brown to black body hair.
What it does:Tria Hair Removal Laser 4X gets to work immediately. The diode laser targets the pigment in the hair follicle to permanently disable the hair follicle’s ability to regrow hair, without damaging the surrounding skin. See visible results following your first two treatments and be on your way to clinically-proven results for your whole body for less than the cost of two professional treatments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    This product is designed to work on fair to medium skin tones with contrasting light brown to black body hair. The Tria Laser 4X has five energy levels. For best results, use the highest setting that you can tolerate.
