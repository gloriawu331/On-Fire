Love it! I am fair to medium with yellow undertones, I use No.2 however a tip from Burberry is to use No.3 to get rid of blue tones, therefore I purchased both No.2 & No.3 and I love the way it works! Build able coverage, perfect and natural. Well done!Love this concealer. It hides my dark circles, doesn't dry out my skin, and is very natural-looking. What's not to love?I have dark circles and olive skin and have been looking for the best concealer. The shade and sheer is very light yet sits in fine lines. The push button applicator is not very functional and the built in brush holds too much of product. Had high hopes for a luxurious product with lasting coverage but this doesn't hit the mark.I love everything about it! No. 02 is a perfect colour for concealer but it does not provide the luminous look that I expect. Not for light skin tone.I expected more, it's really liquidty. Not the best coverage.Love this stuff. Very similar to the YSL Touche Eclat Pen , but I think this stuff is a bit easier to blend. I'll use this under my eyes, on the bridge of my nose, cupid's bow, and forehead, and this stuff blends very easily and leaves a very natural result. Doesn't crease, either, no matter how much product you use. Packaging is great and lasts a long time. Only con is maybe the lack of shades in the range.
