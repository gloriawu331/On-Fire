This cream drenches with healing moisture to soften and help revitalize the look of skin. Skin appears refreshed and delicately scented with the Lilac Path fragrance. 
 
Evocative lilac infuses the scent with depth and is heightened by lush fragrant galbanum. Creamy jasmine lactones blend with soft angelica seed oil and Orange Flower.
