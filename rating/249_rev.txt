It works but you have to be careful it can pull your hair ..So far I'm giving it a go! Not seeing major results but have faith in this little device. The hyaluronic acid Serem is amazing!!I only used this item once but had to return it. When I used the device on my forehead I felt a weird pulling of my scalp and had a residual tingling sensation.I'm sure it was tightening muscles but I was concerned about this weird movement and feeling since the rest of my face did not have the same pulling feeling.
