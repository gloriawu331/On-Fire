I love this conditioner! It is seriously detangling and moisturizing. The scent is pleasant but heavy, however it does not stay around long enough to interfere with perfume. I got a nice sized bottle as a GWP at a NY department store, and I'm glad that Sephora is now carrying it. It's a great line. As reference, I have thick color-treated hair and my usual HG conditioner is Oribe signature. I like this just as much; it is actually thicker and more "feminine" in scent.
