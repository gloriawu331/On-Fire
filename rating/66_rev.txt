I got this as a free sample, so I'm not as angry as I would be if I had actually paid for it, but in short it's really smelly and doesn't seem to do anything. It's definitely rich, but it kind of disappears when you put it on your hair and doesn't seem to do anything. It smells like grass clippings, but not in a good way. I love me some freshly mowed grass smell, but this smells awful.I got this as a free sample, so I'm not as angry as I would be if I had actually paid for it, but in short it's really smelly and doesn't seem to do anything.
