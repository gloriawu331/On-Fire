First off you would pay this much for 1 product. I love the Thermal Cleansing Balm, and have bought it a few times. The full size lasted me almost an entire year. Also loved the deep cleansing mask. Well actually I loved all the products, and the cute little mask remover. It works well at removing everything. When I rinsed it off I was surprised that it was still white. I still think the Thermal Cleansing Balm is worth its weight in gold. My skin feels great and it really feels clean. This set is a definite 5 star buy!I have been using Hungarian skincare for 30 years. I was delighted to hear about this line and ran out to buy the mud cleanser as soon as it was available. It feels wonderful on the skin as its being used & and the glow afterwards is amazing. I want to try the whole line but in the meantime, I am going to get this set that Sephora is offering. It has all of the Hungarian mud cleansing products in a bundle for a very reasonable price! Actually I will buy this for myself, and give it to my husband to give to me for the holidays. Try and enjoy!
