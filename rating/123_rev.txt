I originally purchased Collette, Cleopatra duo because I wanted to have Collete without getting a full bottle. To my surprise I love, love Cleopatra. My only downside is that it doesn't last for but a few hours. But the upside is reapplying. That's how much I love it.
 Sensual and doesn't dry powdery! Compliments galore!I originally purchased Collette, Cleopatra duo because I wanted to have Collete without getting a full bottle.
