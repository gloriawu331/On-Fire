What it is:A four-piece set of essentials for tight curls that provides constant nourishment and hydration using fast-absorbing ingredients that won’t weight hair down.
What it is formulated to do:The Moisturizing Shampoo adds intense levels of moisture without external, suppressive weightrehydrating hair from within for natural curl formation with greater definition and manageability. The Moisturizing Conditioner infuses intense levels of moisture, vitamins, and botanicals into tight curls while algae extract and wheat amino acids flatten and seal the cuticle to encourage lasting curl formation. The Moisturizing Styling Gel builds and holds style from inside the hair strand, injecting weightless moisture into curl cuticles and sealing dehydrated hair strands so they can assume frizz-free definition. And the Finishing Mist Setting & Holding Spray combines powerful polymers with nourishing jojoba oil and hydrolyzed silk to create the ideal blend of softness and staying power for long-lasting, defined curls.
