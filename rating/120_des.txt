Discover the sustainable sophistication of CLEAN Reserve with this trio of travel sprays. Each CLEAN Reserve fragrance was created to be dynamic and evoke, not memories of the past, but possibilities and experiences yet to be discovered. Each is linear without much movement from top to bottom, making it ideal for layering and blending.

Reserve Sueded Oud is a fresh and creamy approach to a traditional oud fragrance. It is a discovery of natural textures and an exploration of the fluid movement between the brighter and darker facets of fragrance.

Reserve Blonde Rose is not an ordinary floral fragrance, it is for anyone who loves to be feminine with an edge. A sophisticated blend of rose, jasmine, and peony, it reminds of the classic, yet modern femininity that’s fresh and sexy. Men can wear it too, especially when paired with Sueded Oud.

Reserve Blend Warm Cotton is for those who currently love Warm Cotton, or anyone who prefers to smell quintessentially clean. The fragrance envelops you in pure freshness that’s bright and comfortable. Its essence lies in the irresistible freshness of translucent florals and the soft feel of skin-loving musks for the ultimate feeling of luxurious comfort.
