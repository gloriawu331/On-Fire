I have two small sprays of Caron's Poivre and was deeply disappointed in them, getting only clove . . . . bleh. Then came POIVRE ELECTRIQUE!!!! Oh my God this is gorgeous. Goes on strong smelling of leather and flowers and I must be honest, I'm not sure what, but it is so beautiful and gives the most realistic, yet beautifully fragrant rendition of leather than I own (and I have a lot of the classics). This deserves to be a classic for all time, something written about 50 years from now saying "remember Poivre Electrique, why don't they make them like that anymore. . . .?" I may have to buy 3 bottles in case they reformulate. Oh almost forgot, great sillage and lasting power. Remarkable and unforgettable.When I read the frag notes I HAD to order this as I am always pleasantly surprised at what this house does! I own almost the entire collection that Sephora carries both online and in store. I work for Sephora and ordered it 'on a whim' as our store does not have the new collection. Although I can appreciate the art of the connoisseur who created this fragrance it smells like an old car or someone who hangs out in a room non stop of rancid insence.... Sad to say this is my first Atelier fail! If u love Samarkland insence u will love this.......
