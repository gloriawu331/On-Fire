All I have to say is ever since I stopped using this my face started breaking out. I always went to get a sample but this time I have to purchaseAlmost returned--tried several days and did not see results--was very unhappy thinking about the $ paid. Somehow decided to give it several more days, and the acne was gone!!! Tried so many products, and this is the only one worked. Now I use once every other day and still OK. Thank you! Worth it!These pads are amazing! They really work! I cut them in half, because using twice a day is a little too drying, but i noticed results after 1 week!Yes, it does a good job at clearing acne BUT it strips the skin. I went to my esthetician after using this and she said not so good things. Thankfully, it didn't cause permanent damage. Be careful with this. It has acetone in it. :(Got this for my boyfriend. Did it's job to keep acne at bay and get rid of old blemishes. VERY solid product. Could hurt sensitive skin, so I'd suggest starting at a low concentration.Finally - an over the counter product that gets RID of acne! This powerhouse product takes about a week to kick in...but stay with it because your acne is going "bye bye!" i broke out worse at first but stayed with this product and the results are smooth, clear skin. DO IT!
