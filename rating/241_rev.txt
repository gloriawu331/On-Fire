I admit I only tried this body moisturizer because I wanted to smell Oud Wood but didn't want to pay $200+ for the perfume. My first time using it I thought I hated it and it smelled like old man and that I would immediately return. But I gave it a few minutes and now I LOVE it. It smells very classy, masculine but not too much. 
 I put it on after my evening bath and it still lingers on clothes next day. I would probably repurchase.
