Great mask. Always hydrating and soothing.You get 7 masks, but I find that each individual package can be split in half and used twice - and that's applying REALLY generously. Definitely a better value when you get 14 uses out of the package. 
 Different concept, in that you leave it on for 10 minutes and then massage it into the skin - no rinsing required. Would be amazing to use on a long flight or car ride.I love everything about this product: the very smart single dose packaging you can take for travels, the smell and texture of the product and the results!! It's the best hydrating mask I have ever tried. My skin feels supple, hydrated, all the dry patches around my nose are gone. My skin is visibly refreshed and glowing. I will definitely keep this stocked as a new staple!Love! Perfect for travel!Great mask.
