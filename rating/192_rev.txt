I really wanted to love this product. It left my skin feeling unbelievably soft and supple; I went to bed feeling completely rejuvenated and woke up to see a smoother appearance and, I swear, smaller pores. However, I have combination acne prone skin and I suffered continuous breakouts in my problem areas. It broke my heart to have to exchange it, but alas, it was not meant to be. I'm rating it a 3 due to my personal experience, but please do consider your own qualities and know that the cream did everything it was supposed to do.
