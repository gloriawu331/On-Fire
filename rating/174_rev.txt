Can't understand why this doesn't have more likes. I've been looking for a pencil that gloss on smoothly, doesn't smudge and has no parabens. I've tried some others but my sensitive eyes got irritated. Love this one! Didn't give a 5 because I like a pencil to stay on overnight if needed and this one unfortunately doesn't. Will still try in another color though. So excited!I'll be returning this because the color refused to stay on my lower lids and just came right off after application. I'll be sticking with my urban decay eyeliner from now on. For the price, I expected more.Like the other Giorgio Armani line, this product has the smoothest, silkiest texture; goes on so easily. The black color is also saturated. My issue is that it doesn't stay put on my lids. Within 3 hours the raccoon eyes start making their appearance. Definitely not waterproof as advertised. So sad; I had to toss it.I generally am not a fan of pencil eyeliners because they tend to smear easily. However, I really like this pencilâ€”the colors are beautiful, the pencil goes on very smoothly and really stays in place.
