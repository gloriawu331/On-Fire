I love this set! I have combination skin so the pressed powder helps with being oily throughout the day. The primer is great because it doesn't break me out while keeping me hydrated. The little sizes are great for on the go, the pressed powder fits in the pocket of most of my pants too so it's always portable! I bought my second one so far.I would highly recommend this powder for anyone with oily and/or combo skin!!
