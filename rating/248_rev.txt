I absolutely love the way my face feels after I finish using this. I kept touching my face in disbelief! It was so smooth!! The smoothness lasted for days! Definitely worth the money and I highly recommend!! I'm going to use it right now!!Not impressed by this product at all. I read all the reviews before purchasing and I couldn't be more disappointed. Trying to return for refund. Makes skin soft for an hour no longer. Doesn't improve acne, doesn't full get all dead skin, and is hard to use. Waste of money. Very unhappy.
