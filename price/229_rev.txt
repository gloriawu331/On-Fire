Love love this shadow! Second time I've ordered and the only shadow I have used all of it! Nude Pink #508! The BEST!I got this palette in navy and the beautiful colors barely show up on my tan skin. It basically looks like a gray mess. I've used CD eyeshadows in the past and have never had an issue...maybe they changed their formula? Either way, not worth the money when there are less expensive brands that deposit more pigment.Excellent quality eyeshadow and cream liner. Packaging is the classic Dior and the shadow I chose is perfect on me and the liner is a huge bonus! Choose which palette is right for YOU... some on here seem to complain and it is probably because they were not careful at picking the right palette for their skin shade! Different palettes are darker or more neutral and you should not complain about the color if you just chose the wrong one online because this is truly excellent quality and an amazing set to do a beautiful eyelid!Very natural looking and it's easy even for beginnersI ordered this palette online and I thought it was a natural palette. It looks very dark and grey on me and the shadows are hard to blend. Also the shadows fade rather quickly even when using a primer. Very disappointed considering the brand and the price.I love Dior eye shadows and had mever had a problem with any of then until now. These shadowsThis palette gives a really soft, natural look, but is not very versatile. Love the gel liner that's built in and the little liner brush.Like all Dior products, this is high quality! The colors are sheer and the shimmer is very slight! This is my favorite of all the eyeshadow palettes I own. All of the colors are created to be used together and it is wonderful for someone like me who can make mistakes on my own. Beautiful polished finish.The only decent color in this whole set is the center one. The top left is decent, too. The "base" is horrible. I bought his palette and within 1 month, I've already reached the bottom of the pan. The top right "shimmer" color is so glittery, I can't even remove it from my face with makeup remover. The only reedeming aspect of this palette is the liner in the bottom right, which is very creamy and strongly pigmented. Overall, I hate this palette.Love love this shadow!
