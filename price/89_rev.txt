I bought this set because, with my nickname being mermaid, I felt a little obligated (the name, the beautiful packaging... It sang to me like Ariel singing to Eric)
 But the cute marketing details are the only props I can give this set.
 Maybe it's just me, but when I think "mermaid" I think fresh, clean, watery scents. These products have a distinctly woodsy scent, thanks to the pine needle oil and rosemary. Woodsy mermaids? Not my jam.
 The dry shampoo comes in a container that looks like it might contain foot powder. For those of us who have become accustomed to spray formula dry shampoo... Good luck not making a mess with this and looking like you obviously applied dry shampoo.
 For the sea salt spray, honestly, this is no better (or worse) than any other sea salt spray I have tried. For the money I would rather have one that didn't make me smell like I went a little crazy with a man's cologne.
 The hair oil, which I never would have doubted I would love, also left my hair smelling cologne-like, but worse-still even only using a small amount, evenly distributed through my decently-long, curly hair left my hair (particularly the ends, which usually devour any hair oil I use, such as Argan oil) feeling tacky once it air dried. 
 Overall I really wanted to love this set, but the products don't live up to their cute name or packaging, and certainly not for the size product, the price per product (though as a set it's a much better value than each product alone), or the odd woodsy scent for a water-themed brand and product line.I have been addicted to this brand and their deodorant and dry shampoo for about a year now. I was THRILLED when I saw Sephora start to carry the brand. I got this set and I am ab absolutely hooked on the sea spray. It is the best one I have every used. It leaves your hair, light, not crunchy and not dried (like my previous favorite sea spray by B&B) IT SMELLS AMAZING. I need to buy the gold spray now too and I am almost in need of a second bottle of mermaid spray since it is SO GOODALL my favorite CB products in one set! I am giving this to all my friends this summer. It is the best present at a great price.... Thank you, CB!!!This stuff is amazing. i haven't heard of this brand until a while ago and did some digging on reviews. Didn't find much but everyone who reviewed said they loved it. Now I know why! I have a medium amount of shoulder length, pin straight hair, which doesn't take too kindly to sea salt sprays. I applied a few drops of the oil to my damp hair, and sprayed my whole head with the salt spray and scrunched along the way. The products smell amazing, the oil keeps my hair hydrated, and the sea salt doesn't give your hair a coarse feeling like other sprays might. My hair feels like butter. I haven't tried the dry shampoo yet but i can't wait. This stuff is a must buy if you have difficulty waving your hair without hot tools. The packaging is also beautiful too.I bought this set because, with my nickname being mermaid, I felt a little obligated (the name, the beautiful packaging...
