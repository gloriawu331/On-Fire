I ordered this for my boyfriend because he kept using my "good" stuff. He really likes it, even asking if it comes in a larger size. He's not really one to ask for anti-aging or pore minimizing, but as "face lotion" for him, it's perfect! It has a pleasant smell--a little manly but not as strong as cologne.I got this for my fiancé and he enjoys it but doesn't see a significant difference. He likes it to moisturizer after using a scrub. The smell isn't maple as I hoped. He likes the scent but I'm not a fan. I can smell it for a good few hours even after its dried down.I ordered this for my boyfriend because he kept using my "good" stuff. He really likes it, even asking if it comes in a larger size.
