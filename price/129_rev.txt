I've tried Fresh's other toners and it just did not work as WONDERFUL as this one. You can feel how soft and moisturised right after you apply this toner!This is a fantastic product! I have been using it since 2012. TheIs product is one of my faves!I've been using this as a base for 6 months now. I saw drastic improvement to my skin tone. It retains the moisture and firms my skin. I love it!I love Fresh products but this one is not worth the high cost. Have tried many other toners that are equal to or better than this one at 1/3 the price. Don't bother with this one.It's not bad, but was expecting more from this particular FRESH product, not as moisturizing and softening as it claims to be, I wouldn't repurchase it.I've tried Fresh's other toners and it just did not work as WONDERFUL as this one.
