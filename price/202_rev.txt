I used this today for the first time. I was really impressed! Not sticky or cakey, it did a great job hiding under eye circles!!I was not blessed with flawless skin. The devil has punished me with acne in my teens and now I have scars. Thankfully, the heavens brought down this gem. It is easy to apply, just pat that ish and slay like a bisch! Would recommend 10/10.I am surprised by the negative reviews so far...I really like this product. It works great on under eye area and doesn't crease, and it comes with a very tiny nice brush that works great for tiny sot concealing. My HG is my cle de peau but it is so expensive, this took the redness out of my nose area almost as good as CDP does. It isn't cheap, but I like this better than my Nars radiant and the new Urban Decay concelar.So small. Coverage is not greatI was disappointed. The "High Coverage" was not there for me and the compact is very expensive.I wear Georgio Armani makeup and this concealer blends in perfectly and is not thick as so many are! I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it.I love Armani s concealers. This one I just had to try. It was nothing special. This is definitely not worth the price.
