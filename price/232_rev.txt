Let me preface by saying I love mineral products and usually only use mineral powders/foundations. I love KGD products, in general. The pressed powder (not yet carried by Sephora) is my favorite, but I also love the Aqua foundation and the loose powder. Recently, I've been trying to go for a 'lighter' look and I've been using the loose powder for this. However, this powder is 'hydrating ' and I tend to be too oily after a few hours. This is the perfect addition. I finish with this all over and stay about as shine-free as I can get. Very light in the case, however it blends beautifully. I have light skin with pink undertones and don't have any problems with it being too white or pink.Let me preface by saying I love mineral products and usually only use mineral powders/foundations.
