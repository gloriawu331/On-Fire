What it does:
 This hydra-boost lip gloss is formulated with special gel color polymers to provide ultimate lip cushion, while locking in color and shine. Lip Pen Gloss is neither too shiny, nor too sticky, and it gives lips just the right amount of sheer coverage and is infused with gel polymer technology that creates long-lasting softness and cushion, while a complex reduces water loss in lips while locking in color and shinemaintaining lush, hydrated, and volumized lips. The lightweight, creamy gloss accentuates your finest features while creating neutral, barely-there, fresh-faced lips with only a touch of color. 

This set contains:
- 0.05 oz Lip Pen Gloss
- Black pencil case

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
- Sulfates

What else you need to know:
NUDESTIX is the brainchild of sisters Ally and Taylor, as well as their chemical engineer mother, Jenny. They all love all-out natural makeup, opting for that barely-there look with only a touch of color to accentuate their finest features. Since current makeup brands and collections simply don’t measure up to their no-nonsense attitude, they created this concealer pencil. NUDESTIX believes that your natural skin should thrive, and that you only need to cover here and there to get that perfect, nude-but-better-look. Flaunt your ‘pretty pout’ proudly and take a selfie! #n_stix and get #instafamous.
