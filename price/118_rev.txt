All of there products are amazing worked at a med spa and the number one products for all skin types and for correcting skin color also you wear this right after a facial treatment and it's amazing ! Truly worthy of every penny and skin issues and skin heath!Sun protection is huge for me living in Texas. Color science is a convenient way for me to reapply sunscreen without messing up my makeup. It applies just like a mineral powder and is so travel friendly. I'm glad I got the 3 pack cause i will use this multiple times through out the day!I got this with high expectations for what was described as a mostly translucent powder good for more skin tones. This "medium" shade was TERRIBLY orange. Felt so stupid going home fromortgage work with a changed face from lunch time application.Could have been a five star until I found several large, consecutive, distinct, entire fingerprints inside the powder-holding clear plastic cartridge. Powders that were meant for my face are touching and mingling with whatever's in that print. I bought them brand new so it could only have came from manufacturing. Think about where those hands might have been to make those prints, and might have also installed the brush which also comes into direct contact with your face.This sunscreen is the best. It is the only sunscreen my son will wear. Between surfing, boogie boarding and soccer we use this product 3 to 4 times a day. It is a must-have. I have been using Colorscience for over 10 years now. It has saved my skin. So convenient to carry and apply. It won't clog your pores so you never have breakouts. LIving in San Diego, I'm in the sun a lot and I never leave home without Colorscience.I love this product and love this bundle even more! It's basically buy 2 get 1 free!!
