I really didn't see any difference between this or any other hair mask (natural) that I've used except for the ridiculous price! It's basically a mask and you add the oil! Which you could do with any hair mask!The smell was absolutely horrible! Couldn't get it out of my nose for what it seemed like forever! Had to store it in a ziplock and returned it!This product might seem too expensive and like it's making bizarre claims about detoxification of the scalp, but it does work. I use only Rahua products these days because it's the best natural shampoo in the world.I really didn't see any difference between this or any other hair mask (natural) that I've used except for the ridiculous price!
