This eye concentrate works well as a moisturizer. It does not irritate my eyes and a little goes a long way which is great! The lid isn't snug and slips off easily, so I haven't been traveling with it. I've been using it for a few months now, but not sure I see brightening or tightening effects. I likely won't re-purchase this product.This eye concentrate works well as a moisturizer. It does not irritate my eyes and a little goes a long way which is great!
