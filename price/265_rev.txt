For some reason when I got this I was expecting sample sized glosses since an individual gloss is $28 and I got the bag and 3 glosses for $52...to my surprise it was 3 full sized beautiful glosses in the collectible bag! I'm very please with my purchase! Great deal! Grab it while you can!I've never tried MJ glosses so I'm very satisfied with this set b/c the glosses have staying power, great pigmentation & they're not sticky or goopy. Also, a nice, minty taste - not overpowering at all. Love, love, love this set!!I heard these lip glosses were amazing, but never wanted to splurge on them in fear of them just turning out to be regular old lip glosses. I figured since this set was such a great deal, I would finally take a chance and try them out. I am glad I did! They are the best lip glosses I have ever used.I can't believe how great of a price it is for this set! I love these glosses, they are beautiful without being sticky. The LE pouch that it came in is everything though. It's a great quality and so unique. I'd pay $50 for the case alone. I love everything about this and will most definitely get the other LE set!This set is amazing! A fantastic formula that isn't sticky at all, yet lasts a good length of time. This set gives you 3 glosses (one of which is new). They come out to be $18 a piece.
