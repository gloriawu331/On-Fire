This is it..the best serum for my face..I starting using this for one month after I tried it with a sample..my skin loves it it feels smooth.clarity and my moisturizer goes smoother.everything I want for my skin..I definitely recommend itI so love this product was having so many second thoughts about getting this because of the price but I figured why not invest in me so I did it and I'm so glad I did my skin looks beautiful and my pores have reduced so much I feel I have flawless skin now and I'm just In love with this serum .I don't love experimenting with skin care because I have found so many bad products out there - drying, irritating, tacky, gross. The few products that I like, I tend to stick with. I received a sample of this and after one use, went out to buy it that same day.This oil absorbs immediately so I can then put my regular moisturizer and minimal makeup on over it. My skin is crazy soft after about 5 minutes... noticeable softness - pretty cool. My skin looks healthy and I can't stop petting my cheeks.The not so great is the old lady rose perfume smell, but that goes away or is covered up. The other con is that I can't stop petting my cheeks, which can raise some eyebrows when in public.This will last a really long time (it's been over 6 months and I'm only 1/3 through the bottle), so the price isn't really as high as it seems.i found this was ok for summer, but not strong enough for winter.nice scent, non irritating.This is it..the best serum for my face..I starting using this for one month after I tried it with a sample..my skin loves it it feels smooth.clarity and my moisturizer goes smoother.everything I want for my skin..I definitely recommend itThis is it..the best serum for my face..I starting using this for one month after I tried it with a sample..my skin loves it it feels smooth.clarity and my moisturizer goes smoother.everything I want for my skin..I definitely recommend itI so love this product was having so many second thoughts about getting this because of the price but I figured why not invest in me so I did it and I'm so glad I did my skin looks beautiful and my pores have reduced so much I feel I have flawless skin now and I'm just In love with this serum .This is it..the best serum for my face..I starting using this for one month after I tried it with a sample..my skin loves it it feels smooth.clarity and my moisturizer goes smoother.everything I want for my skin..I definitely recommend itI so love this product was having so many second thoughts about getting this because of the price but I figured why not invest in me so I did it and I'm so glad I did my skin looks beautiful and my pores have reduced so much I feel I have flawless skin now and I'm just In love with this serum .I don't love experimenting with skin care because I have found so many bad products out there - drying, irritating, tacky, gross.
