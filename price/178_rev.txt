The quality and attractiveness of the brush are above any criticism.The bristles grab and apply color beautifully. This is flat so it's made for patting color onto the lid. I love it!!!This is a soft brush that picks up powder e/s with the lightest touch. I can even apply UD shimmery e/s with no fall out. It's not quite as soft as the smoky eye brushes from his line but still very soft. I've have no shedding at all.The quality and attractiveness of the brush are above any criticism.The bristles grab and apply color beautifully.
