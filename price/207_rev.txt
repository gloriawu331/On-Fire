I usually use the shiseido brightening masks they're $68 and I used to swear by them but these sk masks are the holy grail they feel SO GOOD and refreshing to put on your face and your face needs to be treated once in a while so it's definitely worth the splurge! I also use the essence water from sk but I think personally the masks are sk's best product!I wanted to like SKII so badly even it was so expensive. Unfortunately it is not for me because after I use it, my face have little red bumps and my face and neck is itchy. For the first 2 mask it did not happened to me but it happened to me on the 3rd one i tried and I thought it was me, and the 4th mask it happened again and this time the little bumps last 2 days. So sad it did not work and wasted my money. I am glad it worked for other people :(Very effective mask, help my skin tone lightened!!The result is magnificent!!!!These masks are awesome!! I love the way my skin feels...even after the 1st use. Definitely will continue purchasing these...Now this is something I dont regret blowing my budget on!Used this for the first time last night, I was super shocked that it was cloth like. Felt amazing while I had it on and after my skin looks and feels amazing. I had a very very red reaction all the next day but that's worth it, my skin feels wonderful.I have problem skin and have been gearing up for my wedding...so far this product is even better than the original mask! The formula is less goopy, and I couldn't believe how glowy my face looks without makeupI use this mask once a week after exfoliating and I think it works pretty well. It's super hydrating, and it certainly softens the skin on my face. The only problem I've found is that the day after I use it, my skin is very, very red. I have a ruddy complexion that I am constantly trying to downplay, so I find this irritating, but I generally think it's good for my skin. The day after redness does not happen after I only exfoliate, so by process of elimination I have determined it's the mask. However, I have had fewer breakouts and less oil since I started using it, without my face feeling like I've stripped it bare. It's expensive, but there are 10 masks in the pack, and I use it rather than going to get facials, so it ends up being less expensive for me.wow amazing mask! first time I use it, and I am in love. I fell asleep so I had it on for like 30 minutes, but its cool sensation was very relaxing. After I woke up, my skin looks radiant!i even had some small blackheads and pimples, they all went away!amazing effect on my skin, cant say anything but WOW!!!I also have the regular treatment mask, this one is definitely better!This is the best mask I have ever used. It simultaneously plumps, hydrates, tightens, and brightens. The fabric mask covers your entire face and even has eye flaps to get your eyelids and bags. There is so much serum in there, I spread it all over my chest and arms before resting for 20 mins. I have used this four times so far before parties -- the result? 1) Make-up goes on amazingly 2) People cannot believe how wonderful you look and will say so repeatedly and 3) your skin will just glow, period. I have used all of the SK-II masks, including the more expensive 3D, and this is the best, in my opinion. I use them sparingly!I usually use the shiseido brightening masks they're $68 and I used to swear by them but these sk masks are the holy grail they feel SO GOOD and refreshing to put on your face and your face needs to be treated once in a while so it's definitely worth the splurge!

It simultaneously plumps, hydrates, tightens, and brightens. The fabric mask covers your entire face and even has eye flaps to get your eyelids and bags. There is so much serum in there, I spread it all over my chest and arms before resting for 20 mins. I have used this four times so far before parties -- the result? 1) Make-up goes on amazingly 2) People cannot believe how wonderful you look and will say so repeatedly and 3) your skin will just glow, period. I have used all of the SK-II masks, including the more expensive 3D, and this is the best, in my opinion. I use them sparingly!
