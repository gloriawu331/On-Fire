I've been wanting to get hair removal for awhile but wasn't willing to pay the price to have it done so I'm really happy I found this device. It's seriously so easy and effective. I have fine blonde hair which can be somewhat resistant but it worked like a charm!I have very resistant body hair, especially underarm and bikini area. I used to always shave, wax or sugar those areas. I bought a few session of laser treatments also through groupons and I was still struggling. Then, I bought the Touch after many researches. I followed instruction and gave myself treatments on time every week. It has been 4 months now, I noticed minimal regrowth from my underarm area, and bikini area has great improvement also. I cannot wait to be summer when my treatment would have full effect by then!I've had my illuminage for over a year, but I don't have the precision adapter. I've gone through months where I use it more vs less. It's time consuming: it requires shaving before using and I tend to go over my skin slowly to maximize results so I always find it tedious. 
 The results on my legs were much better than I expected. During the summer, I shaved much less often since hair growth was minimized. But without doing regular maintenance upkeep, all the hair grows again and goes back to where I started. 
 I was never that satisfied by the results on my underarms. While it did supress hair growth, it wasn't so amazing that I felt comfortable in a sleeveless shirt without shaving that day. 
 Finally, I have some random dark hairs on my jaw line and neck. It somewhat helped to supress growth, but also meant that a dark hair might be stunted and sit at a short length just below the skin so I could see its end but not tweeze it. Possibly the precision adapter would help to get better results. 
 My hair is dark and plentiful, my skin is light. 
 I read a lot of reviews before I bought this over a year ago. At the time, I also saw that the results anyone got from this product varied by person and by their expectations. 
 So purchase knowing you will have to spend time to get results, then a little less time to keep those results going. If you don't like the results you get, return it. I kept mine and will continue to use it knowing it's not magic.I usually don't write review but for this machine I have to..before buying it I did quite a bit research because of money factor. It is expensive purchase. I only used once and saw slight hair reduction and was exited to use for second use it flashed couple a times and than stopped flashing. I can hear the click but not flashing. The cartilage is not empty because I just used once. I am really disappointedlI purchased this full price expecting hair reduction within 3 months, as advised in the product description. what i got was hair reduction after almost 1 year of continuous use. med/light skin w medium hair here. for the first 4 months i was diligent in using the machine 1x a week, going over up and down the leg and underarms. I did BY NO MEANS notice anything immediate. at all. after 1 year i have noticed considerable hair REDUCTION on my lower leg, some reduction in the underarm and no reduction on my upper lip (i purchased the precision adapter) i was no expecting miracles when i purchased this unit. i cant say it has not worked, i am glad i have it but it is a time investment for sure. i now use it only when i feel like it and i still shave.Easy to use, painless and I saw results after using it twice! Not sure why all the bad reviews...Fair skin, dark hair here.I was fed up with being embarrassed of my very dark hair on my Mexican but light complexion. I tried several different salon treatments for a few years & that was a total waste of money & more importantly time. I was desperate when I bought this at home product. OMG I was amazed at how great it worked. It was my most treasured product. I gave it 4 stars only because it stopped working after about 6-8 months. I did not use it as you are recommended to, I used it on "my" time. I'm not one for saving much let alone receipts, but I figured I only wanted an exchange anyhow so I went in. They did not carry it at the store I went to but they gave me a complete refund because I bought it on my "beauty insider" account, so they had record of the purchase. I plan to order it again & use it on my legs. PS I tried it on my facial peach fuzz as well, I figured why not, omg my face looked brighter without the hair. The salons had said I would never be able to lose my peach fuzz because it was so fine....ha! Liars, THEY couldn't do it is all. I LUV this product, it worked for me.This really truly does NOT work. Do not waste your money. I used it for months, once a week, as instructed. I have light skin and dark hair, and had no results at all.I am using this tool for 6 months now, started as per recommendation-every week for first 6 weeks and am still waiting for results. I have light scan and dark (black) medium fine hair, technically the best conditions possible for this tool to start working, but it doesn't. I tried similar tools in salons they provided drastic difference, I could see unwanted hair literally disappear within weeks. With this product, there is no results whatsoever, please save your money, you can get decent in salon he air removal corse for 600$ that actually works! Time and money waster.I've been wanting to get hair removal for awhile but wasn't willing to pay the price to have it done so I'm really happy I found this device.

I cannot wait to be summer when my treatment would have full effect by then!I've had my illuminage for over a year, but I don't have the precision adapter. I've gone through months where I use it more vs less. It's time consuming: it requires shaving before using and I tend to go over my skin slowly to maximize results so I always find it tedious. 
 The results on my legs were much better than I expected. During the summer, I shaved much less often since hair growth was minimized. But without doing regular maintenance upkeep, all the hair grows again and goes back to where I started. 
 I was never that satisfied by the results on my underarms. While it did supress hair growth, it wasn't so amazing that I felt comfortable in a sleeveless shirt without shaving that day. 
 Finally, I have some random dark hairs on my jaw line and neck. It somewhat helped to supress growth, but also meant that a dark hair might be stunted and sit at a short length just below the skin so I could see its end but not tweeze it. Possibly the precision adapter would help to get better results. 
 My hair is dark and plentiful, my skin is light. 
 I read a lot of reviews before I bought this over a year ago. At the time, I also saw that the results anyone got from this product varied by person and by their expectations. 
 So purchase knowing you will have to spend time to get results, then a little less time to keep those results going. If you don't like the results you get, return it. I kept mine and will continue to use it knowing it's not magic.I've been wanting to get hair removal for awhile but wasn't willing to pay the price to have it done so I'm really happy I found this device. It's seriously so easy and effective. I have fine blonde hair which can be somewhat resistant but it worked like a charm!I have very resistant body hair, especially underarm and bikini area.

I tried several different salon treatments for a few years & that was a total waste of money & more importantly time. I was desperate when I bought this at home product. OMG I was amazed at how great it worked. It was my most treasured product. I gave it 4 stars only because it stopped working after about 6-8 months. I did not use it as you are recommended to, I used it on "my" time. I'm not one for saving much let alone receipts, but I figured I only wanted an exchange anyhow so I went in. They did not carry it at the store I went to but they gave me a complete refund because I bought it on my "beauty insider" account, so they had record of the purchase. I plan to order it again & use it on my legs. PS I tried it on my facial peach fuzz as well, I figured why not, omg my face looked brighter without the hair.

Do not waste your money. I used it for months, once a week, as instructed. I have light skin and dark hair, and had no results at all.I am using this tool for 6 months now, started as per recommendation-every week for first 6 weeks and am still waiting for results. I have light scan and dark (black) medium fine hair, technically the best conditions possible for this tool to start working, but it doesn't. I tried similar tools in salons they provided drastic difference, I could see unwanted hair literally disappear within weeks. With this product, there is no results whatsoever, please save your money, you can get decent in salon he air removal corse for 600$ that actually works! Time and money waster.
