Well I should have paid more attention to the ounces and not the packaging. I bought this as a gift but now it will be a stocking stuffer because it is very small for the price.I have used other moisturizers from Clinique to Belif to Kiehls... This is by far the best one I have used.... It is a bit thick but absorbs quickly and provides excellent hydration... I recently ran out of it after having it for a year since I only use it during the winter months and I am definitely missing it and need to buy another one asap for the cold, dry Ohio winters.Well I should have paid more attention to the ounces and not the packaging.
