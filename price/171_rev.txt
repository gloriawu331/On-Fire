Pros:-stays put and long lasting (I think it's comparable to Stila Stay all Day liner)-modern brown is medium brown with a subtle sheen and a little bronze glitter--but not too much for day time
 CONs:-slightly, but not terribly watery-applicator is not exceptionally thin and makes it hard to apply a clean line 
 You have to click a button on the bottom on the pen a few times to release the product on the brush. In theory it sounds like a good idea but it makes it hard to apply because the product builds up at the base of the brush while the tip is bare.Pros:-stays put and long lasting (I think it's comparable to Stila Stay all Day liner)-modern brown is medium brown with a subtle sheen and a little bronze glitter--but not too much for day time
