I use this concealer to cover dark circles under my eyes and to conceal acne scars and red acne, you do have to blend it out right away, but once applied and dried, coverage is completely buildable and I didn't need to color correct before applying concealer saving me a step and another product I no longer need to purchase.I've used lots of concealer from different brands. My fave is NARS because of the consistency but then I found this Black UP concealer and I love it. I love the shade but I dislike the applicator because it's too wet and it seems to run out quickly and I don't even use it a lot. Other than that I like it but it's pretty pricy to run out so quickly (approximately 1 Mont of use and not every day)This is the best concealer for my skin tone. I have searched long and hard for a concealer that would brighten by under eye area; Nars, Tarte, Clinique, Urban Decay. Every other product I've tried has had a neutral undertone to it whereas my undertone is yellow leaning golden. The closet I got to a good match was Urban Decay's medium light but even still would need to add Georgio Armani's yellow corrector to bring it up to what I was looking for. That is just way too many steps. 
 When I had yet another makeup consultation at Sephora, Crystal, matched me perfectly. It has the right combination of what I like. I don't have dark circles or any under eye concerns except I didn't want it to sink into any fine lines. After wearing it for a few days, it performs well. 
 The only reason I gave it 4 stars, I don't like the brush applicators, I prefer the sponge tip. All the clicking to get the product is just way too much. Other than that, this is a good product.I really don't care for this product, I really want to love Black up ! but its turning into a bad thing. The Color range is perfect but the product seems very runny and it doesn't conceal a thing.
