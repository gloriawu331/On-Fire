The description promises more than the product delivers. I love the tube and the cold, refreshing feeling it provides but compared to any other lip moisturizer, it's nothing special. Not worth the price.Diasapointed...didn't like the directions for application..still working on this...if you have time for makeup application perhaps this product is for you..it does provide hydration for the lipsIm 27 so I don't have many lines, but I have the smile lines by my cheeks that bother me, I decided to spring for this product because it sounded promising.
 I've used the massaging techniques, applied a good amount of product but I don't notice any change. As a plus, it is lightly hydrating and non irritating, but not worth the price for me because it did not do what was expected.First off, let me start off by saying that my review is 100% genuine and not influenced in any way. My review for this product is so good, I don't want people to think it isn't real. I have smile lines on each side of my mouth. I am EXTREMELY self conscious of them. I never wanted to wear lipstick in fear that it would draw attention to the aging area on my face. I went to two dermatologists and two plastic surgeons in the hopes that they could fill these lines around my mouth. Each time, they told me, they weren't bad enough yet and the result wouldn't be natural looking. One of the dermatologists prescribed me Retin A to try to help treat them. I used retin a for over a year and dealt with horrible dry red patches that never got better, even though I tried a million different ways to stop it(mixing with lotion, skipping a day, etc) needless to say, it only magnified the smile lines around my mouth. Over the past three years, I have tried desperately to find a cream that would make a difference for my smile lines. I've spent over $300 on creams and as little as $25 on a well known store brand. I've tried over twenty and non helped. None of them did ANYTHING. I use the gold eyetech from Guerlain, so when I saw this, I thought why not? It has the most amazing smell and is very rich. The first couple of times I used it, I got a couple of white "pimples". I hate to even call them that because there was no redness associated with them and they are the kind you pop quick and they are gone. I think it maybe because the cream is so rich. This cream makes an ASTRONOMICAL difference in my smile lines! I still can't believe it. They aren't completely gone but they are so much faded and my skin is so plump where I use this! Nothing else has ever worked before! I can wear lipstick again. This really works!! It has made such a difference. No drying at all, just positive results! I was reading the reviews on here and saw that some users have been applying this directly on their lips. I figured I would try it and now my lips look amazing! They are so plump! When I put lipstick on or pass a mirror, I feel like I'm looking at my "new lips". I put this on before my regular moisturizer and give it a few minutes to sink in. I let it sit on my lips for about ten minutes before applying gloss. I can't recommend this enough and I hope they never discontinue it. It is worth every penny!I chosen this item because of natural ingredients.I used for 2 weeks morning and night instead of lip balm that I usually used. It made my lip very dry during day time. The seller recommended not use chemical lip stick for a while. So I did. I didn't use this one for last 2 weeks. My lip is better now. I brought back to return. The seller made me try one more time in front of her to make sure I used it right way or not. She said I am doing right. After trying one more time, my lip is really dry now. So I am sure it doesn't work to me. 2 star for the design ..enjoy using it because of the design, but no difference after finish a tube.It's a good product. But not worth the price. It' dose smooth and soft your lips. But if you don't apply lip balm after, you'll get dry very fast. if you apply lip balm after before you sleep, you will get a good result in the morning.I have tried many balms and plumpers and I have difficulty finding anything to keep my lips smooth enough to wear lipstick. I have tried scrubs to remove the rough skin on my lips but it doesn't seem to help. I have full lips with deep creases and any lipstick seems to settle in the creases and look messy. I have used this product for two weeks and have seen a notable change in the contour of my lips and condition of my lips. They are fuller and smoother and I can wear matte lipstick now all day with no cracking or creasing. I was skeptical of the price on this product but I am glad I splurged. The applicator is a bit strange and I followed the process for the nightly massage using it but I am not sure that it does much, I found I got a very small breakout on my upper lip and smile line massaging it there so I think I will keep it on my lips only.When I first received this I wondered whats up with this contraption? Very gimmicky, then I read the directions and noticed that this is very useful for massaging the lips and plumping them. Now this is NOT a lip balm, but what it does it plumps the lips and if you use the tool that it comes with you'll be amazingly surprised at the difference it makes. I am the kind of person that gets extremely chapped lips, so much so that the bleed, and using this and a little bit of generic lip balm has totally solved this problem. There is a video in the Guerlain website that teaches how to massage the nasolabial folds, the edges of your lips to get a more lifted look. Once again Guerlain, you never disappoint. Don't ever stop making it. I am forever in love with this brand.I had my makeup done by Marcus Monson this past Saturday and he used this on my lips. I loved the way it felt so I have been using it everyday since. I had dry and cracked lips before and in just 3 full days of using this my lips are transformed very soft and moisturized. I love love love this product, a bit pricey but oh so worth it. Previous to this I had been using the balm by la Mer this is so much better! Thank you Marcus and Guerlain for a wonderful product.I started getting tiny lines on my upper lip so I panicked. I have to say this is really amazing. I don't know if it's a filler or if it moisturizes so well that they have started to fade. I am in love with it and highly recommend.The description promises more than the product delivers.

As a plus, it is lightly hydrating and non irritating, but not worth the price for me because it did not do what was expected.First off, let me start off by saying that my review is 100% genuine and not influenced in any way. My review for this product is so good, I don't want people to think it isn't real. I have smile lines on each side of my mouth. I am EXTREMELY self conscious of them. I never wanted to wear lipstick in fear that it would draw attention to the aging area on my face. I went to two dermatologists and two plastic surgeons in the hopes that they could fill these lines around my mouth. Each time, they told me, they weren't bad enough yet and the result wouldn't be natural looking. One of the dermatologists prescribed me Retin A to try to help treat them. I used retin a for over a year and dealt with horrible dry red patches that never got better, even though I tried a million different ways to stop it(mixing with lotion, skipping a day, etc) needless to say, it only magnified the smile lines around my mouth. Over the past three years, I have tried desperately to find a cream that would make a difference for my smile lines. I've spent over $300 on creams and as little as $25 on a well known store brand. I've tried over twenty and non helped. None of them did ANYTHING. I use the gold eyetech from Guerlain, so when I saw this, I thought why not? It has the most amazing smell and is very rich. The first couple of times I used it, I got a couple of white "pimples". I hate to even call them that because there was no redness associated with them and they are the kind you pop quick and they are gone. I think it maybe because the cream is so rich. This cream makes an ASTRONOMICAL difference in my smile lines! I still can't believe it. They aren't completely gone but they are so much faded and my skin is so plump where I use this! Nothing else has ever worked before! I can wear lipstick again. This really works!! It has made such a difference. No drying at all, just positive results! I was reading the reviews on here and saw that some users have been applying this directly on their lips. I figured I would try it and now my lips look amazing! They are so plump! When I put lipstick on or pass a mirror, I feel like I'm looking at my "new lips". I put this on before my regular moisturizer and give it a few minutes to sink in. I let it sit on my lips for about ten minutes before applying gloss. I can't recommend this enough and I hope they never discontinue it. It is worth every penny!I chosen this item because of natural ingredients.I used for 2 weeks morning and night instead of lip balm that I usually used. It made my lip very dry during day time. The seller recommended not use chemical lip stick for a while. So I did. I didn't use this one for last 2 weeks. My lip is better now. I brought back to return. The seller made me try one more time in front of her to make sure I used it right way or not. She said I am doing right. After trying one more time, my lip is really dry now. So I am sure it doesn't work to me. 2 star for the design ..enjoy using it because of the design, but no difference after finish a tube.It's a good product. But not worth the price. It' dose smooth and soft your lips. But if you don't apply lip balm after, you'll get dry very fast. if you apply lip balm after before you sleep, you will get a good result in the morning.I have tried many balms and plumpers and I have difficulty finding anything to keep my lips smooth enough to wear lipstick. I have tried scrubs to remove the rough skin on my lips but it doesn't seem to help. I have full lips with deep creases and any lipstick seems to settle in the creases and look messy. I have used this product for two weeks and have seen a notable change in the contour of my lips and condition of my lips. They are fuller and smoother and I can wear matte lipstick now all day with no cracking or creasing. I was skeptical of the price on this product but I am glad I splurged. The applicator is a bit strange and I followed the process for the nightly massage using it but I am not sure that it does much, I found I got a very small breakout on my upper lip and smile line massaging it there so I think I will keep it on my lips only.When I first received this I wondered whats up with this contraption? Very gimmicky, then I read the directions and noticed that this is very useful for massaging the lips and plumping them. Now this is NOT a lip balm, but what it does it plumps the lips and if you use the tool that it comes with you'll be amazingly surprised at the difference it makes. I am the kind of person that gets extremely chapped lips, so much so that the bleed, and using this and a little bit of generic lip balm has totally solved this problem. There is a video in the Guerlain website that teaches how to massage the nasolabial folds, the edges of your lips to get a more lifted look. Once again Guerlain, you never disappoint. Don't ever stop making it. I am forever in love with this brand.I had my makeup done by Marcus Monson this past Saturday and he used this on my lips. I loved the way it felt so I have been using it everyday since. I had dry and cracked lips before and in just 3 full days of using this my lips are transformed very soft and moisturized. I love love love this product, a bit pricey but oh so worth it. Previous to this I had been using the balm by la Mer this is so much better! Thank you Marcus and Guerlain for a wonderful product.The description promises more than the product delivers. I love the tube and the cold, refreshing feeling it provides but compared to any other lip moisturizer, it's nothing special. Not worth the price.Diasapointed...didn't like the directions for application..still working on this...if you have time for makeup application perhaps this product is for you..it does provide hydration for the lipsIm 27 so I don't have many lines, but I have the smile lines by my cheeks that bother me, I decided to spring for this product because it sounded promising.

Not worth the price.Diasapointed...didn't like the directions for application..still working on this...if you have time for makeup application perhaps this product is for you..it does provide hydration for the lipsIm 27 so I don't have many lines, but I have the smile lines by my cheeks that bother me, I decided to spring for this product because it sounded promising.
 I've used the massaging techniques, applied a good amount of product but I don't notice any change. As a plus, it is lightly hydrating and non irritating, but not worth the price for me because it did not do what was expected.First off, let me start off by saying that my review is 100% genuine and not influenced in any way. My review for this product is so good, I don't want people to think it isn't real. I have smile lines on each side of my mouth. I am EXTREMELY self conscious of them. I never wanted to wear lipstick in fear that it would draw attention to the aging area on my face. I went to two dermatologists and two plastic surgeons in the hopes that they could fill these lines around my mouth. Each time, they told me, they weren't bad enough yet and the result wouldn't be natural looking. One of the dermatologists prescribed me Retin A to try to help treat them. I used retin a for over a year and dealt with horrible dry red patches that never got better, even though I tried a million different ways to stop it(mixing with lotion, skipping a day, etc) needless to say, it only magnified the smile lines around my mouth. Over the past three years, I have tried desperately to find a cream that would make a difference for my smile lines. I've spent over $300 on creams and as little as $25 on a well known store brand. I've tried over twenty and non helped. None of them did ANYTHING. I use the gold eyetech from Guerlain, so when I saw this, I thought why not? It has the most amazing smell and is very rich. The first couple of times I used it, I got a couple of white "pimples". I hate to even call them that because there was no redness associated with them and they are the kind you pop quick and they are gone. I think it maybe because the cream is so rich. This cream makes an ASTRONOMICAL difference in my smile lines! I still can't believe it. They aren't completely gone but they are so much faded and my skin is so plump where I use this! Nothing else has ever worked before! I can wear lipstick again. This really works!! It has made such a difference. No drying at all, just positive results! I was reading the reviews on here and saw that some users have been applying this directly on their lips. I figured I would try it and now my lips look amazing! They are so plump! When I put lipstick on or pass a mirror, I feel like I'm looking at my "new lips". I put this on before my regular moisturizer and give it a few minutes to sink in. I let it sit on my lips for about ten minutes before applying gloss. I can't recommend this enough and I hope they never discontinue it. It is worth every penny!I chosen this item because of natural ingredients.I used for 2 weeks morning and night instead of lip balm that I usually used. It made my lip very dry during day time. The seller recommended not use chemical lip stick for a while. So I did. I didn't use this one for last 2 weeks. My lip is better now. I brought back to return. The seller made me try one more time in front of her to make sure I used it right way or not. She said I am doing right. After trying one more time, my lip is really dry now. So I am sure it doesn't work to me. 2 star for the design ..enjoy using it because of the design, but no difference after finish a tube.It's a good product. But not worth the price. It' dose smooth and soft your lips. But if you don't apply lip balm after, you'll get dry very fast. if you apply lip balm after before you sleep, you will get a good result in the morning.I have tried many balms and plumpers and I have difficulty finding anything to keep my lips smooth enough to wear lipstick. I have tried scrubs to remove the rough skin on my lips but it doesn't seem to help. I have full lips with deep creases and any lipstick seems to settle in the creases and look messy. I have used this product for two weeks and have seen a notable change in the contour of my lips and condition of my lips. They are fuller and smoother and I can wear matte lipstick now all day with no cracking or creasing. I was skeptical of the price on this product but I am glad I splurged. The applicator is a bit strange and I followed the process for the nightly massage using it but I am not sure that it does much, I found I got a very small breakout on my upper lip and smile line massaging it there so I think I will keep it on my lips only.When I first received this I wondered whats up with this contraption? Very gimmicky, then I read the directions and noticed that this is very useful for massaging the lips and plumping them. Now this is NOT a lip balm, but what it does it plumps the lips and if you use the tool that it comes with you'll be amazingly surprised at the difference it makes. I am the kind of person that gets extremely chapped lips, so much so that the bleed, and using this and a little bit of generic lip balm has totally solved this problem. There is a video in the Guerlain website that teaches how to massage the nasolabial folds, the edges of your lips to get a more lifted look. Once again Guerlain, you never disappoint. Don't ever stop making it. I am forever in love with this brand.The description promises more than the product delivers.

Don't ever stop making it. I am forever in love with this brand.I had my makeup done by Marcus Monson this past Saturday and he used this on my lips. I loved the way it felt so I have been using it everyday since. I had dry and cracked lips before and in just 3 full days of using this my lips are transformed very soft and moisturized. I love love love this product, a bit pricey but oh so worth it. Previous to this I had been using the balm by la Mer this is so much better!

Thank you Marcus and Guerlain for a wonderful product.I started getting tiny lines on my upper lip so I panicked. I have to say this is really amazing. I don't know if it's a filler or if it moisturizes so well that they have started to fade. I am in love with it and highly recommend.
