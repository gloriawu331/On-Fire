Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better. I guess my skin condition wasn't great when i first used it lol. I personally find it easier to blend with a sponge rather than a brush or patting it down with a finger. 
 I got palette 01, the range is quite versatile. from the light to the dark, i can pretty much fully utilise most of the colours so it wasn't a waste. Not sure if i'll repurchase though, because of the price tag haha.I really like this palette. For me, it works. A lot of cream concealer palettes I get dry out really easily. I usually have to use my Farsali oil to hydrate them so I can apply them easily. But this palette never dries! The colors work really really well for me. They blend so beautifully. The bronzer concealers are the best. It's so hard to find cream bronzers that work for your skin and blend easily. It doesn't look muddy like other cream bronzers. The only thing that bothers me is that I wish they had larger quantities of the concealer for the price. They are rather small. But for the variety you get, I guess it's okay. I've bought it twice, and once I run out I will probably do so again.This is confusing and I may even go as far as to say- a scam!.. I am fair/light and I purchased both 1&2 palettes. I can use half the shades on both palettes to correct imperfections and color correct. I don't know why they don't just make a fair/light palette and a separate medium/dark palette. There is no way one person can use all of the shades on one of these palettes. Maybe the idea is for professional makeup artists to use in their kit on multiple people but even so, separate palettes divided into skintones would be much more useful. Will be returning.I liked this palette for about two months. Then I noticed it getting harder and harder (dry) for product to come off of palette and unto my brush. There is literally a hard film or something on top of most of these squares now. It also smells like old rancid make up now. I am a make up artist and had a client say, "EW, what smells?!". Obviously, I will not be able to use it anymore. Not cool.I bought this a while back after talking myself out of it over and over. 80 bucks is a lot of money, even for someone as big of a beauty product addict as me. It is worth it though, even though some of the colors are far too warm toned to be used for contouring, I still use them on lazy days as a quick eye color. You can cover dark under eye circles, angry hormonal zits and their fading dark reminders with just a smidge of this densely pigmented cream. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, due to the warmth of the bottom tones.This pallet offers good coverage and the green corrector shade is amazing. I wish there were more midrange neutral shades.This is a lovely palette however, I don't recommend buying this if you're only looking for a concealer or for occasional use. It also didn't do the best job hiding some of my dark spots on my face and work off quickly. I would've given it a higher rating, but for the price and rave reviews I expected it to be a bit better. I have the elf concealer palette and it covers the same amount for a fraction of the price.I own the 01 Viseart palette and I have to say it is one of the best invest, in makeup, I have made. I use this mainly for my really dark circles and it works wonders. It does not crease and it feels light wieght. I only had to use a little bit since it has very good pigmentation. This palette is also good for correcting, highlighting, and contouring. I love it. It is worth the price.I'm sure that this product is great for anyone who will be working on many different skin types but I can only use about half of the colors on myself. The bottom row is much warmer than in the pictures and shows up pretty orange. But goes on well and can cover my under eyes perfectly.I was hoping to fall in love with this product, but I didn't. This kit is extremely pigmented, which I absolutely adore; however, the darker colors are all too warm for my skin tone. They blend out orange. I only use the light yellow shade to correct my skintone under my foundation. Individuals with warmer skintones might be able to utilize this product a lot more than I have. I wish it was worth the money for me. :(I love the consistency and the thicknessI bought this online with my 20% off. I read the reviews and was so excited to have something that I could use for a concealer and a contour. I am blond hair, blue, eyed, with pale skin, I am 38 years old with very few wrinkles around my eyes. The dark circles around my eyes were my #1 concern, I played with this for hours and while I could get it to correct the circles, it just felt heavy and cakey. My #2 concern was contouring, again, the colors were fine but it just felt to heavy on my skin. I see this as being something better suited for a makeup artist but for an everyday go to product, it's not worth the price.I absolutely LOVE this concealer palette. They are so intensely pigmented. One touch of my finger or brush is all it takes to cover dark circles, redness, scars, you name it! The formula is very creamy as well, and blends like a dream.
 My only criticism is that the contour shades (bottom row) are WAY too warm to contour with. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
 However, i found a way to make it work.. Contour before foundation and do NOT blend. Then use beauty blender to pat on foundation to get a flawless, not-orange contour.
 Overall, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this item.I purchased Palette 2 earlier this year when it was the only palette available; I was sort of impressed with it and made it work, but found myself only using about 5 of the shades on a regular basis. When I saw Palette 1 was available, I ordered it immediately! Although I have only had this for a short time, I can say I have used it EVERY DAY; it really works PERFECTLY for concealing and color correcting; I purchased this explicitly because I have dark circles and under eye bags due to chronic illness and medications; I can really cover these problems up very well with this palette. The texture is really perfect; it is a very smooth, thin cream that can be covered with foundation and concealer after it dries for about 20 minutes. I have not found an equally high quality color correction/concealer palette or even single product - and believe me, I have TONS of them. It is quite expensive at $80, but I do not regret the purchase whatsoever. Also a TINY bit of this product goes a very long way; these are not thick cream consistency, but they are highly pigmented. This is one of my top 10 MUST-HAVE makeup items hands down.Was really excited to try this based on the good reviews. For the price, I thought this was going to be amazing. My intention when buying this was to correct, conceal, and contour (what this product is meant for). It did not correct my redness. The consistency was odd. It was between oily and grainy. Didn't blend as well as expected. I tried using my fingers, a brush, a damp beauty blender. It just wasn't working for me. I attempted to mix the shades on the back of my hand but the concealer just sunk right in and didn't give me a chance to mix it. Maybe mixing it on a plastic surface would have worked. Either way, I wanted this to be a one stop shop to cover all my makeup needs: conceal, correct, contour, and not be difficult to fuss with. The contour shades weren't bad. The concealers were okay. Correctors didn't work with my kind of redness. For $80, it wasn't mind blowing. Wish I loved it as much as other users.I have been eyeing this palette for a while, and with the VIB rouge sale recently I knew I had to buy it. Based on all the good reviews I really was expecting something AMAZING. This was not the case. I do have dry skin, but I heavily moisturize in the morning and use a hydrating primer: these still felt dry on my skin. I noticed through the day they almost just cracked in some places? That sounds weird but I had to keep trying to blend them out through the day and I absolutely never have this issue with makeup, and I wear makeup daily. They also felt dry in the pan, it's not like they just felt dry on the skin. I think if you have oily skin these might work well for you, but with dry skin I was SERIOUSLY unimpressed. It's also important to note that the colors are much more orange in person than they appear in that picture (I got 01 palette).
 I think the top row were definitely the creamiest, and the bronzer/contour shades I almost felt were grainy? Maybe I got a bad pan but they definitely feel GRAINY.
 Be cautious when buying. I personally wouldn't recommend this.I've been a loyal fan of the NARS radiant creamy concealer for a few years now, but was looking for some color correction concealers to mix into my routine. After coveting this palette for a few months, I finally purchased it during the November 20% off promo. And it was completely worth it. The individual NARS concealers are about $30 each and, since my tone changes seasonally, I always have to buy a new shade every few months. With this palette, It'll probably be a year or two until I buy a new concealer.
 The texture is also insanely creamy and pigmented without sitting heavily in the creases under my eyes. I am so amazed, wasn't sure it'd be worth the price, but it really is. Can't recommend this enough. Best concealer formula I've found yet.
 Only downside is that it's hard to take out in a small purse for touch ups, as it requires a brush or clean hands. Will probably keep my NARS around for going out at night.I ordered the number 1 based on the few reviews here, I have medium skin color. I search on the Internet for more reviews but there is almost none, I am surprised because the quality of this product amazing. The colors are beautiful to used as a highlighter, contour, eyeshadow, or concealer. I used the salmon and yellow colors to conceal my dark circles, it works better than NARS, I used the medium browns as a transition color eyeshadow it stays all day without creasing, the dark browns are beautiful for contouring. The ligh green gets rid of the redness around my nose immediately. The colors are creamy they slide on the skin and blend beautifully making my skin look young, a plus they stay all day. This is one of the best sets I own, I definitely recommend this product. Very versatile.I love spending time researching, buying and using makeup and skin care products; I detest spending the time to write reviews. Well here I am writing a review for the Viseart Concealer Palette 01 (with the pale green in it). I had to. It is worth every cent I paid for it. I have 5 criteria when I review a product. 1. Appearance - the packaging is simple and the concealers are housed in an good quality acrylic palette. The concealers looked fresh and inviting to use. (+1*) 2. Smell - there is no discernible odor with these cream concealers (+1*). 3. Accuracy of Product Claim - every little bit of these concealers matter because with a few tiny dabs and a 35 year old dark scar seemingly disappeared. Shades are easily blendable. Product blends easily. Coverage is the best I have ever experienced. No cake face with this stuff. (+1*). 4. Application & Removal - very easy to apply and get desired results whether it be lighter or heavier coverage. Removes easily with regular skin cleansing routine. 5. Overall value - Yes! $80 seems steep but this will last you a long while. These concealers definitely conceals, covers, camouflages, contours. I love trying new products and most that I've tried are mediocre and can easily be compared to other brands. Viseart is not an easy comparison to match. If quality and product integrity is important to you, this is a must try.I have watched this for months. Just kept eyeing it but didn't want to spend $80 on concealer . What is wrong with me!? I should have ordered day 1. It is one of the best concealers I've EVER tried. First, you get a good amount of product for the money . it goes on like butter, very smooth . It also blends seamlessly . It has a great variety of colors where you can mixThe key to finding a good shade to conceal with this is not being afraid to mix colors. I added just a tad of the red hue to the peachy pink and bam- totally covered my bluish under eye circles. I'm very pale, so the red scared me but I read up on color theory and how to cancel out certain tones and this palette is great for that if you play with it. I think I will get some versatility from this.I have purple pigmentation under my eyes (thanks Mom) and 95% of concealers won't cut it for me. Not Dior, not MUFE, not Kat Von D. I have been using Amazing Cosmetics' concealer for several years and it has been doing a decent job. However, the flaws are that it creases heavily and one tube costs $40; because I tan at times, I need 2-3 shades to match my skintone. Until now.
 I've been eyeing this palette for quite some time, and the spectrum of colors first piqued my interest. It has a greenish corrector as well as 7 peach-hued shades varying from very fair porcelain shade to dark tan, so I'll be able to use this year round (yay!). I'm planning on using the dark tans for contouring. I tried a swatch of them on my hand just now and even they are pigmented as the lighter colors, so a little will go a long way.
 $80 is expensive, yes, but if you are in need of several concealers at once, or if you have very pigmented undereye areas, this is well worth the investment. I wish I had known this all before I purchased the Anastasia contouring kit (horrid) and more concealer!
 If you give this a try, you will not be disappointed.I have the #2 conceal/contour palette. As a concealer it's great. (A little too red for contouring). It's noticeably better quality than most concealers I've tried and it better be for $80! Only weird thing is it's very affected by the weather. If there's any humidity, the palette will have droplets of water on it and will be too creamy consistency. if it's dry the colors will be extremely dry verging on chalky which is harder to work with on already dry skin. Overall very happy with it though. The coverage for under eye circles is excellent since you can custom mix the colors. fun too!Love the colors. Great tones and consistency. Doesn't cake up and greatCoverage. I'm very very fair skin, I use the red tones for my dark circles and the light colors to highlight and conceal. There's no reason this palette has less than 5 stars; unless you pick the wrong palette for your skin tone/color :)I have olive tones in my complexion, chronic dark circles, and work 12 hour shifts. For 10 years I've looked for a concealer that actually conceals without looking caked on and one that lasts all day. I love having the options of so many colors in one palette -allows for great custom blend. And really ...BARELY use any product to cover my circles, blends beautifully and doesn't crease or dry my skin. I have 1 of the eyeshadow palettes and plan on investing in all their palettes. The quality isI thought the MUF camouflage palette # 5 was really good, but in comparison, this palette is better both in quality and price point. It's very creamy, emollient and I need just a touch (and I mean a light touch) for coverage. I need it to tone down redness (neutralize) and highlight. This does a beautiful job without streakiness or tugging. My skin tone ranges from a light beige to medium beige ( MUF face & body makeup # 32 or # 34); the colours in this palette is perfect.I love how blendable this concealer is as I can gently layer on colour or shade over shade. I've noticed larger pores are developing in certain areas around my nose and cheek area (it's age related) and the concealers help to cover up and make my skin look smoother.I've researched this prior to purchasing and there were comments on blogs and videos about the packaging being a bit on the cheap side. I must have the new packaging as the plastic cover and case looks and feels sturdy and substantial. It's quite compact ( just a little larger than the palm of my hand) and very portable, Ease of use, blendable, good coverage, the right colour range, sturdy packaging, portable and good value for my money, speaks of a quality product in my view.This palette is absolutely wonderful. It's creamy, blendable, and most of all DOES NOT CREASE!!! It's very expensive but having such a rainbow of colors in one palette, you can't go wrong honestly. I got the 01 palette. I have a bit of redness on my cheeks and the green works so well at correcting it. I really love this palette. Def worth every penny. NO CREASING HERE!!If you are looking to just use this palette to correct and conceal, then this product is definitely for you. This palette is creamy, easy to work with, and blends seamlessly. The packaging is compact and durable. The only thing I did not like is that the contour colors in this palette run on the warm side and have reddish tones (more like a bronzer). I personally like a grey-toned or neutral-toned brown to contour with.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better.

The bronzer concealers are the best. It's so hard to find cream bronzers that work for your skin and blend easily. It doesn't look muddy like other cream bronzers. The only thing that bothers me is that I wish they had larger quantities of the concealer for the price. They are rather small. But for the variety you get, I guess it's okay. I've bought it twice, and once I run out I will probably do so again.This is confusing and I may even go as far as to say- a scam!.. I am fair/light and I purchased both 1&2 palettes. I can use half the shades on both palettes to correct imperfections and color correct. I don't know why they don't just make a fair/light palette and a separate medium/dark palette. There is no way one person can use all of the shades on one of these palettes. Maybe the idea is for professional makeup artists to use in their kit on multiple people but even so, separate palettes divided into skintones would be much more useful. Will be returning.I liked this palette for about two months. Then I noticed it getting harder and harder (dry) for product to come off of palette and unto my brush. There is literally a hard film or something on top of most of these squares now. It also smells like old rancid make up now. I am a make up artist and had a client say, "EW, what smells?!". Obviously, I will not be able to use it anymore. Not cool.I bought this a while back after talking myself out of it over and over. 80 bucks is a lot of money, even for someone as big of a beauty product addict as me. It is worth it though, even though some of the colors are far too warm toned to be used for contouring, I still use them on lazy days as a quick eye color. You can cover dark under eye circles, angry hormonal zits and their fading dark reminders with just a smidge of this densely pigmented cream. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, due to the warmth of the bottom tones.This pallet offers good coverage and the green corrector shade is amazing. I wish there were more midrange neutral shades.This is a lovely palette however, I don't recommend buying this if you're only looking for a concealer or for occasional use. It also didn't do the best job hiding some of my dark spots on my face and work off quickly. I would've given it a higher rating, but for the price and rave reviews I expected it to be a bit better. I have the elf concealer palette and it covers the same amount for a fraction of the price.I own the 01 Viseart palette and I have to say it is one of the best invest, in makeup, I have made. I use this mainly for my really dark circles and it works wonders. It does not crease and it feels light wieght. I only had to use a little bit since it has very good pigmentation. This palette is also good for correcting, highlighting, and contouring. I love it. It is worth the price.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better. I guess my skin condition wasn't great when i first used it lol. I personally find it easier to blend with a sponge rather than a brush or patting it down with a finger.

One touch of my finger or brush is all it takes to cover dark circles, redness, scars, you name it! The formula is very creamy as well, and blends like a dream.
 My only criticism is that the contour shades (bottom row) are WAY too warm to contour with. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
 However, i found a way to make it work.. Contour before foundation and do NOT blend. Then use beauty blender to pat on foundation to get a flawless, not-orange contour.

 Overall, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this item.I purchased Palette 2 earlier this year when it was the only palette available; I was sort of impressed with it and made it work, but found myself only using about 5 of the shades on a regular basis. When I saw Palette 1 was available, I ordered it immediately! Although I have only had this for a short time, I can say I have used it EVERY DAY; it really works PERFECTLY for concealing and color correcting; I purchased this explicitly because I have dark circles and under eye bags due to chronic illness and medications; I can really cover these problems up very well with this palette. The texture is really perfect; it is a very smooth, thin cream that can be covered with foundation and concealer after it dries for about 20 minutes. I have not found an equally high quality color correction/concealer palette or even single product - and believe me, I have TONS of them. It is quite expensive at $80, but I do not regret the purchase whatsoever. Also a TINY bit of this product goes a very long way; these are not thick cream consistency, but they are highly pigmented. This is one of my top 10 MUST-HAVE makeup items hands down.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better. I guess my skin condition wasn't great when i first used it lol. I personally find it easier to blend with a sponge rather than a brush or patting it down with a finger. 
 I got palette 01, the range is quite versatile. from the light to the dark, i can pretty much fully utilise most of the colours so it wasn't a waste. Not sure if i'll repurchase though, because of the price tag haha.I really like this palette. For me, it works. A lot of cream concealer palettes I get dry out really easily. I usually have to use my Farsali oil to hydrate them so I can apply them easily. But this palette never dries! The colors work really really well for me. They blend so beautifully. The bronzer concealers are the best. It's so hard to find cream bronzers that work for your skin and blend easily. It doesn't look muddy like other cream bronzers. The only thing that bothers me is that I wish they had larger quantities of the concealer for the price. They are rather small. But for the variety you get, I guess it's okay. I've bought it twice, and once I run out I will probably do so again.This is confusing and I may even go as far as to say- a scam!.. I am fair/light and I purchased both 1&2 palettes. I can use half the shades on both palettes to correct imperfections and color correct. I don't know why they don't just make a fair/light palette and a separate medium/dark palette. There is no way one person can use all of the shades on one of these palettes. Maybe the idea is for professional makeup artists to use in their kit on multiple people but even so, separate palettes divided into skintones would be much more useful. Will be returning.I liked this palette for about two months. Then I noticed it getting harder and harder (dry) for product to come off of palette and unto my brush. There is literally a hard film or something on top of most of these squares now. It also smells like old rancid make up now. I am a make up artist and had a client say, "EW, what smells?!". Obviously, I will not be able to use it anymore. Not cool.I bought this a while back after talking myself out of it over and over. 80 bucks is a lot of money, even for someone as big of a beauty product addict as me. It is worth it though, even though some of the colors are far too warm toned to be used for contouring, I still use them on lazy days as a quick eye color. You can cover dark under eye circles, angry hormonal zits and their fading dark reminders with just a smidge of this densely pigmented cream. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, due to the warmth of the bottom tones.This pallet offers good coverage and the green corrector shade is amazing. I wish there were more midrange neutral shades.This is a lovely palette however, I don't recommend buying this if you're only looking for a concealer or for occasional use. It also didn't do the best job hiding some of my dark spots on my face and work off quickly. I would've given it a higher rating, but for the price and rave reviews I expected it to be a bit better. I have the elf concealer palette and it covers the same amount for a fraction of the price.I own the 01 Viseart palette and I have to say it is one of the best invest, in makeup, I have made. I use this mainly for my really dark circles and it works wonders. It does not crease and it feels light wieght. I only had to use a little bit since it has very good pigmentation. This palette is also good for correcting, highlighting, and contouring. I love it. It is worth the price.I'm sure that this product is great for anyone who will be working on many different skin types but I can only use about half of the colors on myself. The bottom row is much warmer than in the pictures and shows up pretty orange. But goes on well and can cover my under eyes perfectly.I was hoping to fall in love with this product, but I didn't. This kit is extremely pigmented, which I absolutely adore; however, the darker colors are all too warm for my skin tone. They blend out orange. I only use the light yellow shade to correct my skintone under my foundation. Individuals with warmer skintones might be able to utilize this product a lot more than I have. I wish it was worth the money for me. :(I love the consistency and the thicknessI bought this online with my 20% off. I read the reviews and was so excited to have something that I could use for a concealer and a contour. I am blond hair, blue, eyed, with pale skin, I am 38 years old with very few wrinkles around my eyes. The dark circles around my eyes were my #1 concern, I played with this for hours and while I could get it to correct the circles, it just felt heavy and cakey. My #2 concern was contouring, again, the colors were fine but it just felt to heavy on my skin. I see this as being something better suited for a makeup artist but for an everyday go to product, it's not worth the price.I absolutely LOVE this concealer palette. They are so intensely pigmented. One touch of my finger or brush is all it takes to cover dark circles, redness, scars, you name it! The formula is very creamy as well, and blends like a dream.
 My only criticism is that the contour shades (bottom row) are WAY too warm to contour with. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
 However, i found a way to make it work.. Contour before foundation and do NOT blend. Then use beauty blender to pat on foundation to get a flawless, not-orange contour.
 Overall, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this item.I purchased Palette 2 earlier this year when it was the only palette available; I was sort of impressed with it and made it work, but found myself only using about 5 of the shades on a regular basis. When I saw Palette 1 was available, I ordered it immediately! Although I have only had this for a short time, I can say I have used it EVERY DAY; it really works PERFECTLY for concealing and color correcting; I purchased this explicitly because I have dark circles and under eye bags due to chronic illness and medications; I can really cover these problems up very well with this palette.

This is one of my top 10 MUST-HAVE makeup items hands down.Was really excited to try this based on the good reviews. For the price, I thought this was going to be amazing. My intention when buying this was to correct, conceal, and contour (what this product is meant for). It did not correct my redness. The consistency was odd. It was between oily and grainy. Didn't blend as well as expected. I tried using my fingers, a brush, a damp beauty blender. It just wasn't working for me. I attempted to mix the shades on the back of my hand but the concealer just sunk right in and didn't give me a chance to mix it. Maybe mixing it on a plastic surface would have worked. Either way, I wanted this to be a one stop shop to cover all my makeup needs: conceal, correct, contour, and not be difficult to fuss with. The contour shades weren't bad. The concealers were okay. Correctors didn't work with my kind of redness. For $80, it wasn't mind blowing. Wish I loved it as much as other users.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning.

Based on all the good reviews I really was expecting something AMAZING. This was not the case. I do have dry skin, but I heavily moisturize in the morning and use a hydrating primer: these still felt dry on my skin. I noticed through the day they almost just cracked in some places? That sounds weird but I had to keep trying to blend them out through the day and I absolutely never have this issue with makeup, and I wear makeup daily. They also felt dry in the pan, it's not like they just felt dry on the skin. I think if you have oily skin these might work well for you, but with dry skin I was SERIOUSLY unimpressed. It's also important to note that the colors are much more orange in person than they appear in that picture (I got 01 palette).
 I think the top row were definitely the creamiest, and the bronzer/contour shades I almost felt were grainy? Maybe I got a bad pan but they definitely feel GRAINY.

 Be cautious when buying. I personally wouldn't recommend this.I've been a loyal fan of the NARS radiant creamy concealer for a few years now, but was looking for some color correction concealers to mix into my routine. After coveting this palette for a few months, I finally purchased it during the November 20% off promo. And it was completely worth it. The individual NARS concealers are about $30 each and, since my tone changes seasonally, I always have to buy a new shade every few months. With this palette, It'll probably be a year or two until I buy a new concealer.
 The texture is also insanely creamy and pigmented without sitting heavily in the creases under my eyes. I am so amazed, wasn't sure it'd be worth the price, but it really is. Can't recommend this enough. Best concealer formula I've found yet.
 Only downside is that it's hard to take out in a small purse for touch ups, as it requires a brush or clean hands. Will probably keep my NARS around for going out at night.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better. I guess my skin condition wasn't great when i first used it lol. I personally find it easier to blend with a sponge rather than a brush or patting it down with a finger.

This is one of my top 10 MUST-HAVE makeup items hands down.Was really excited to try this based on the good reviews. For the price, I thought this was going to be amazing. My intention when buying this was to correct, conceal, and contour (what this product is meant for). It did not correct my redness. The consistency was odd. It was between oily and grainy. Didn't blend as well as expected. I tried using my fingers, a brush, a damp beauty blender. It just wasn't working for me. I attempted to mix the shades on the back of my hand but the concealer just sunk right in and didn't give me a chance to mix it. Maybe mixing it on a plastic surface would have worked. Either way, I wanted this to be a one stop shop to cover all my makeup needs: conceal, correct, contour, and not be difficult to fuss with. The contour shades weren't bad. The concealers were okay. Correctors didn't work with my kind of redness. For $80, it wasn't mind blowing. Wish I loved it as much as other users.I have been eyeing this palette for a while, and with the VIB rouge sale recently I knew I had to buy it. Based on all the good reviews I really was expecting something AMAZING. This was not the case. I do have dry skin, but I heavily moisturize in the morning and use a hydrating primer: these still felt dry on my skin. I noticed through the day they almost just cracked in some places? That sounds weird but I had to keep trying to blend them out through the day and I absolutely never have this issue with makeup, and I wear makeup daily. They also felt dry in the pan, it's not like they just felt dry on the skin. I think if you have oily skin these might work well for you, but with dry skin I was SERIOUSLY unimpressed. It's also important to note that the colors are much more orange in person than they appear in that picture (I got 01 palette).
 I think the top row were definitely the creamiest, and the bronzer/contour shades I almost felt were grainy? Maybe I got a bad pan but they definitely feel GRAINY.
 Be cautious when buying. I personally wouldn't recommend this.I've been a loyal fan of the NARS radiant creamy concealer for a few years now, but was looking for some color correction concealers to mix into my routine. After coveting this palette for a few months, I finally purchased it during the November 20% off promo. And it was completely worth it. The individual NARS concealers are about $30 each and, since my tone changes seasonally, I always have to buy a new shade every few months. With this palette, It'll probably be a year or two until I buy a new concealer.
 The texture is also insanely creamy and pigmented without sitting heavily in the creases under my eyes. I am so amazed, wasn't sure it'd be worth the price, but it really is. Can't recommend this enough. Best concealer formula I've found yet.
 Only downside is that it's hard to take out in a small purse for touch ups, as it requires a brush or clean hands. Will probably keep my NARS around for going out at night.I ordered the number 1 based on the few reviews here, I have medium skin color. I search on the Internet for more reviews but there is almost none, I am surprised because the quality of this product amazing. The colors are beautiful to used as a highlighter, contour, eyeshadow, or concealer. I used the salmon and yellow colors to conceal my dark circles, it works better than NARS, I used the medium browns as a transition color eyeshadow it stays all day without creasing, the dark browns are beautiful for contouring. The ligh green gets rid of the redness around my nose immediately. The colors are creamy they slide on the skin and blend beautifully making my skin look young, a plus they stay all day. This is one of the best sets I own, I definitely recommend this product. Very versatile.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better. I guess my skin condition wasn't great when i first used it lol. I personally find it easier to blend with a sponge rather than a brush or patting it down with a finger. 
 I got palette 01, the range is quite versatile. from the light to the dark, i can pretty much fully utilise most of the colours so it wasn't a waste. Not sure if i'll repurchase though, because of the price tag haha.I really like this palette. For me, it works. A lot of cream concealer palettes I get dry out really easily. I usually have to use my Farsali oil to hydrate them so I can apply them easily. But this palette never dries! The colors work really really well for me. They blend so beautifully. The bronzer concealers are the best. It's so hard to find cream bronzers that work for your skin and blend easily. It doesn't look muddy like other cream bronzers. The only thing that bothers me is that I wish they had larger quantities of the concealer for the price. They are rather small. But for the variety you get, I guess it's okay. I've bought it twice, and once I run out I will probably do so again.This is confusing and I may even go as far as to say- a scam!.. I am fair/light and I purchased both 1&2 palettes. I can use half the shades on both palettes to correct imperfections and color correct. I don't know why they don't just make a fair/light palette and a separate medium/dark palette. There is no way one person can use all of the shades on one of these palettes. Maybe the idea is for professional makeup artists to use in their kit on multiple people but even so, separate palettes divided into skintones would be much more useful. Will be returning.I liked this palette for about two months. Then I noticed it getting harder and harder (dry) for product to come off of palette and unto my brush. There is literally a hard film or something on top of most of these squares now. It also smells like old rancid make up now. I am a make up artist and had a client say, "EW, what smells?!". Obviously, I will not be able to use it anymore. Not cool.I bought this a while back after talking myself out of it over and over. 80 bucks is a lot of money, even for someone as big of a beauty product addict as me. It is worth it though, even though some of the colors are far too warm toned to be used for contouring, I still use them on lazy days as a quick eye color. You can cover dark under eye circles, angry hormonal zits and their fading dark reminders with just a smidge of this densely pigmented cream. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, due to the warmth of the bottom tones.This pallet offers good coverage and the green corrector shade is amazing. I wish there were more midrange neutral shades.This is a lovely palette however, I don't recommend buying this if you're only looking for a concealer or for occasional use. It also didn't do the best job hiding some of my dark spots on my face and work off quickly. I would've given it a higher rating, but for the price and rave reviews I expected it to be a bit better. I have the elf concealer palette and it covers the same amount for a fraction of the price.I own the 01 Viseart palette and I have to say it is one of the best invest, in makeup, I have made. I use this mainly for my really dark circles and it works wonders. It does not crease and it feels light wieght. I only had to use a little bit since it has very good pigmentation. This palette is also good for correcting, highlighting, and contouring. I love it. It is worth the price.I'm sure that this product is great for anyone who will be working on many different skin types but I can only use about half of the colors on myself. The bottom row is much warmer than in the pictures and shows up pretty orange. But goes on well and can cover my under eyes perfectly.I was hoping to fall in love with this product, but I didn't. This kit is extremely pigmented, which I absolutely adore; however, the darker colors are all too warm for my skin tone. They blend out orange. I only use the light yellow shade to correct my skintone under my foundation. Individuals with warmer skintones might be able to utilize this product a lot more than I have. I wish it was worth the money for me. :(I love the consistency and the thicknessI bought this online with my 20% off. I read the reviews and was so excited to have something that I could use for a concealer and a contour. I am blond hair, blue, eyed, with pale skin, I am 38 years old with very few wrinkles around my eyes. The dark circles around my eyes were my #1 concern, I played with this for hours and while I could get it to correct the circles, it just felt heavy and cakey. My #2 concern was contouring, again, the colors were fine but it just felt to heavy on my skin. I see this as being something better suited for a makeup artist but for an everyday go to product, it's not worth the price.I absolutely LOVE this concealer palette. They are so intensely pigmented. One touch of my finger or brush is all it takes to cover dark circles, redness, scars, you name it! The formula is very creamy as well, and blends like a dream.
 My only criticism is that the contour shades (bottom row) are WAY too warm to contour with. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
 However, i found a way to make it work.. Contour before foundation and do NOT blend. Then use beauty blender to pat on foundation to get a flawless, not-orange contour.
 Overall, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this item.I purchased Palette 2 earlier this year when it was the only palette available; I was sort of impressed with it and made it work, but found myself only using about 5 of the shades on a regular basis. When I saw Palette 1 was available, I ordered it immediately! Although I have only had this for a short time, I can say I have used it EVERY DAY; it really works PERFECTLY for concealing and color correcting; I purchased this explicitly because I have dark circles and under eye bags due to chronic illness and medications; I can really cover these problems up very well with this palette. The texture is really perfect; it is a very smooth, thin cream that can be covered with foundation and concealer after it dries for about 20 minutes.

Very versatile.I love spending time researching, buying and using makeup and skin care products; I detest spending the time to write reviews. Well here I am writing a review for the Viseart Concealer Palette 01 (with the pale green in it). I had to. It is worth every cent I paid for it. I have 5 criteria when I review a product. 1. Appearance - the packaging is simple and the concealers are housed in an good quality acrylic palette. The concealers looked fresh and inviting to use. (+1*) 2. Smell - there is no discernible odor with these cream concealers (+1*). 3. Accuracy of Product Claim - every little bit of these concealers matter because with a few tiny dabs and a 35 year old dark scar seemingly disappeared. Shades are easily blendable. Product blends easily. Coverage is the best I have ever experienced. No cake face with this stuff. (+1*). 4. Application & Removal - very easy to apply and get desired results whether it be lighter or heavier coverage. Removes easily with regular skin cleansing routine. 5. Overall value - Yes! $80 seems steep but this will last you a long while. These concealers definitely conceals, covers, camouflages, contours. I love trying new products and most that I've tried are mediocre and can easily be compared to other brands. Viseart is not an easy comparison to match. If quality and product integrity is important to you, this is a must try.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning.

I should have ordered day 1. It is one of the best concealers I've EVER tried. First, you get a good amount of product for the money . it goes on like butter, very smooth . It also blends seamlessly . It has a great variety of colors where you can mixHmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning.

 My only criticism is that the contour shades (bottom row) are WAY too warm to contour with. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
 However, i found a way to make it work.. Contour before foundation and do NOT blend. Then use beauty blender to pat on foundation to get a flawless, not-orange contour.
 Overall, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this item.I purchased Palette 2 earlier this year when it was the only palette available; I was sort of impressed with it and made it work, but found myself only using about 5 of the shades on a regular basis. When I saw Palette 1 was available, I ordered it immediately! Although I have only had this for a short time, I can say I have used it EVERY DAY; it really works PERFECTLY for concealing and color correcting; I purchased this explicitly because I have dark circles and under eye bags due to chronic illness and medications; I can really cover these problems up very well with this palette. The texture is really perfect; it is a very smooth, thin cream that can be covered with foundation and concealer after it dries for about 20 minutes. I have not found an equally high quality color correction/concealer palette or even single product - and believe me, I have TONS of them. It is quite expensive at $80, but I do not regret the purchase whatsoever. Also a TINY bit of this product goes a very long way; these are not thick cream consistency, but they are highly pigmented. This is one of my top 10 MUST-HAVE makeup items hands down.Was really excited to try this based on the good reviews. For the price, I thought this was going to be amazing. My intention when buying this was to correct, conceal, and contour (what this product is meant for). It did not correct my redness. The consistency was odd. It was between oily and grainy. Didn't blend as well as expected. I tried using my fingers, a brush, a damp beauty blender. It just wasn't working for me. I attempted to mix the shades on the back of my hand but the concealer just sunk right in and didn't give me a chance to mix it. Maybe mixing it on a plastic surface would have worked. Either way, I wanted this to be a one stop shop to cover all my makeup needs: conceal, correct, contour, and not be difficult to fuss with. The contour shades weren't bad. The concealers were okay. Correctors didn't work with my kind of redness. For $80, it wasn't mind blowing. Wish I loved it as much as other users.I have been eyeing this palette for a while, and with the VIB rouge sale recently I knew I had to buy it. Based on all the good reviews I really was expecting something AMAZING. This was not the case. I do have dry skin, but I heavily moisturize in the morning and use a hydrating primer: these still felt dry on my skin. I noticed through the day they almost just cracked in some places? That sounds weird but I had to keep trying to blend them out through the day and I absolutely never have this issue with makeup, and I wear makeup daily. They also felt dry in the pan, it's not like they just felt dry on the skin. I think if you have oily skin these might work well for you, but with dry skin I was SERIOUSLY unimpressed. It's also important to note that the colors are much more orange in person than they appear in that picture (I got 01 palette).
 I think the top row were definitely the creamiest, and the bronzer/contour shades I almost felt were grainy? Maybe I got a bad pan but they definitely feel GRAINY.
 Be cautious when buying. I personally wouldn't recommend this.I've been a loyal fan of the NARS radiant creamy concealer for a few years now, but was looking for some color correction concealers to mix into my routine. After coveting this palette for a few months, I finally purchased it during the November 20% off promo. And it was completely worth it. The individual NARS concealers are about $30 each and, since my tone changes seasonally, I always have to buy a new shade every few months. With this palette, It'll probably be a year or two until I buy a new concealer.
 The texture is also insanely creamy and pigmented without sitting heavily in the creases under my eyes. I am so amazed, wasn't sure it'd be worth the price, but it really is. Can't recommend this enough. Best concealer formula I've found yet.
 Only downside is that it's hard to take out in a small purse for touch ups, as it requires a brush or clean hands. Will probably keep my NARS around for going out at night.I ordered the number 1 based on the few reviews here, I have medium skin color. I search on the Internet for more reviews but there is almost none, I am surprised because the quality of this product amazing. The colors are beautiful to used as a highlighter, contour, eyeshadow, or concealer. I used the salmon and yellow colors to conceal my dark circles, it works better than NARS, I used the medium browns as a transition color eyeshadow it stays all day without creasing, the dark browns are beautiful for contouring. The ligh green gets rid of the redness around my nose immediately. The colors are creamy they slide on the skin and blend beautifully making my skin look young, a plus they stay all day. This is one of the best sets I own, I definitely recommend this product. Very versatile.I love spending time researching, buying and using makeup and skin care products; I detest spending the time to write reviews. Well here I am writing a review for the Viseart Concealer Palette 01 (with the pale green in it). I had to. It is worth every cent I paid for it. I have 5 criteria when I review a product. 1. Appearance - the packaging is simple and the concealers are housed in an good quality acrylic palette. The concealers looked fresh and inviting to use. (+1*) 2. Smell - there is no discernible odor with these cream concealers (+1*). 3. Accuracy of Product Claim - every little bit of these concealers matter because with a few tiny dabs and a 35 year old dark scar seemingly disappeared. Shades are easily blendable. Product blends easily. Coverage is the best I have ever experienced. No cake face with this stuff. (+1*). 4. Application & Removal - very easy to apply and get desired results whether it be lighter or heavier coverage. Removes easily with regular skin cleansing routine. 5. Overall value - Yes! $80 seems steep but this will last you a long while. These concealers definitely conceals, covers, camouflages, contours. I love trying new products and most that I've tried are mediocre and can easily be compared to other brands. Viseart is not an easy comparison to match. If quality and product integrity is important to you, this is a must try.I have watched this for months. Just kept eyeing it but didn't want to spend $80 on concealer . What is wrong with me!? I should have ordered day 1. It is one of the best concealers I've EVER tried. First, you get a good amount of product for the money . it goes on like butter, very smooth . It also blends seamlessly . It has a great variety of colors where you can mixThe key to finding a good shade to conceal with this is not being afraid to mix colors. I added just a tad of the red hue to the peachy pink and bam- totally covered my bluish under eye circles. I'm very pale, so the red scared me but I read up on color theory and how to cancel out certain tones and this palette is great for that if you play with it. I think I will get some versatility from this.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better. I guess my skin condition wasn't great when i first used it lol. I personally find it easier to blend with a sponge rather than a brush or patting it down with a finger. 
 I got palette 01, the range is quite versatile. from the light to the dark, i can pretty much fully utilise most of the colours so it wasn't a waste. Not sure if i'll repurchase though, because of the price tag haha.I really like this palette. For me, it works. A lot of cream concealer palettes I get dry out really easily. I usually have to use my Farsali oil to hydrate them so I can apply them easily. But this palette never dries! The colors work really really well for me. They blend so beautifully. The bronzer concealers are the best. It's so hard to find cream bronzers that work for your skin and blend easily. It doesn't look muddy like other cream bronzers. The only thing that bothers me is that I wish they had larger quantities of the concealer for the price. They are rather small. But for the variety you get, I guess it's okay. I've bought it twice, and once I run out I will probably do so again.This is confusing and I may even go as far as to say- a scam!.. I am fair/light and I purchased both 1&2 palettes. I can use half the shades on both palettes to correct imperfections and color correct. I don't know why they don't just make a fair/light palette and a separate medium/dark palette. There is no way one person can use all of the shades on one of these palettes. Maybe the idea is for professional makeup artists to use in their kit on multiple people but even so, separate palettes divided into skintones would be much more useful. Will be returning.I liked this palette for about two months. Then I noticed it getting harder and harder (dry) for product to come off of palette and unto my brush. There is literally a hard film or something on top of most of these squares now. It also smells like old rancid make up now. I am a make up artist and had a client say, "EW, what smells?!". Obviously, I will not be able to use it anymore. Not cool.I bought this a while back after talking myself out of it over and over. 80 bucks is a lot of money, even for someone as big of a beauty product addict as me. It is worth it though, even though some of the colors are far too warm toned to be used for contouring, I still use them on lazy days as a quick eye color. You can cover dark under eye circles, angry hormonal zits and their fading dark reminders with just a smidge of this densely pigmented cream. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, due to the warmth of the bottom tones.This pallet offers good coverage and the green corrector shade is amazing. I wish there were more midrange neutral shades.This is a lovely palette however, I don't recommend buying this if you're only looking for a concealer or for occasional use. It also didn't do the best job hiding some of my dark spots on my face and work off quickly. I would've given it a higher rating, but for the price and rave reviews I expected it to be a bit better. I have the elf concealer palette and it covers the same amount for a fraction of the price.I own the 01 Viseart palette and I have to say it is one of the best invest, in makeup, I have made. I use this mainly for my really dark circles and it works wonders. It does not crease and it feels light wieght. I only had to use a little bit since it has very good pigmentation. This palette is also good for correcting, highlighting, and contouring. I love it. It is worth the price.I'm sure that this product is great for anyone who will be working on many different skin types but I can only use about half of the colors on myself. The bottom row is much warmer than in the pictures and shows up pretty orange. But goes on well and can cover my under eyes perfectly.I was hoping to fall in love with this product, but I didn't. This kit is extremely pigmented, which I absolutely adore; however, the darker colors are all too warm for my skin tone. They blend out orange. I only use the light yellow shade to correct my skintone under my foundation. Individuals with warmer skintones might be able to utilize this product a lot more than I have. I wish it was worth the money for me. :(I love the consistency and the thicknessI bought this online with my 20% off. I read the reviews and was so excited to have something that I could use for a concealer and a contour. I am blond hair, blue, eyed, with pale skin, I am 38 years old with very few wrinkles around my eyes. The dark circles around my eyes were my #1 concern, I played with this for hours and while I could get it to correct the circles, it just felt heavy and cakey. My #2 concern was contouring, again, the colors were fine but it just felt to heavy on my skin. I see this as being something better suited for a makeup artist but for an everyday go to product, it's not worth the price.I absolutely LOVE this concealer palette. They are so intensely pigmented.

I think I will get some versatility from this.I have purple pigmentation under my eyes (thanks Mom) and 95% of concealers won't cut it for me. Not Dior, not MUFE, not Kat Von D. I have been using Amazing Cosmetics' concealer for several years and it has been doing a decent job. However, the flaws are that it creases heavily and one tube costs $40; because I tan at times, I need 2-3 shades to match my skintone. Until now.
 I've been eyeing this palette for quite some time, and the spectrum of colors first piqued my interest. It has a greenish corrector as well as 7 peach-hued shades varying from very fair porcelain shade to dark tan, so I'll be able to use this year round (yay!). I'm planning on using the dark tans for contouring. I tried a swatch of them on my hand just now and even they are pigmented as the lighter colors, so a little will go a long way.
 $80 is expensive, yes, but if you are in need of several concealers at once, or if you have very pigmented undereye areas, this is well worth the investment. I wish I had known this all before I purchased the Anastasia contouring kit (horrid) and more concealer!
 If you give this a try, you will not be disappointed.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning.

It also blends seamlessly . It has a great variety of colors where you can mixThe key to finding a good shade to conceal with this is not being afraid to mix colors. I added just a tad of the red hue to the peachy pink and bam- totally covered my bluish under eye circles. I'm very pale, so the red scared me but I read up on color theory and how to cancel out certain tones and this palette is great for that if you play with it. I think I will get some versatility from this.I have purple pigmentation under my eyes (thanks Mom) and 95% of concealers won't cut it for me. Not Dior, not MUFE, not Kat Von D. I have been using Amazing Cosmetics' concealer for several years and it has been doing a decent job. However, the flaws are that it creases heavily and one tube costs $40; because I tan at times, I need 2-3 shades to match my skintone. Until now.
 I've been eyeing this palette for quite some time, and the spectrum of colors first piqued my interest. It has a greenish corrector as well as 7 peach-hued shades varying from very fair porcelain shade to dark tan, so I'll be able to use this year round (yay!). I'm planning on using the dark tans for contouring. I tried a swatch of them on my hand just now and even they are pigmented as the lighter colors, so a little will go a long way.
 $80 is expensive, yes, but if you are in need of several concealers at once, or if you have very pigmented undereye areas, this is well worth the investment. I wish I had known this all before I purchased the Anastasia contouring kit (horrid) and more concealer!
 If you give this a try, you will not be disappointed.I have the #2 conceal/contour palette. As a concealer it's great. (A little too red for contouring). It's noticeably better quality than most concealers I've tried and it better be for $80! Only weird thing is it's very affected by the weather. If there's any humidity, the palette will have droplets of water on it and will be too creamy consistency. if it's dry the colors will be extremely dry verging on chalky which is harder to work with on already dry skin. Overall very happy with it though. The coverage for under eye circles is excellent since you can custom mix the colors. fun too!Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better. I guess my skin condition wasn't great when i first used it lol. I personally find it easier to blend with a sponge rather than a brush or patting it down with a finger. 
 I got palette 01, the range is quite versatile. from the light to the dark, i can pretty much fully utilise most of the colours so it wasn't a waste. Not sure if i'll repurchase though, because of the price tag haha.I really like this palette. For me, it works. A lot of cream concealer palettes I get dry out really easily. I usually have to use my Farsali oil to hydrate them so I can apply them easily. But this palette never dries! The colors work really really well for me. They blend so beautifully. The bronzer concealers are the best. It's so hard to find cream bronzers that work for your skin and blend easily. It doesn't look muddy like other cream bronzers. The only thing that bothers me is that I wish they had larger quantities of the concealer for the price. They are rather small. But for the variety you get, I guess it's okay. I've bought it twice, and once I run out I will probably do so again.This is confusing and I may even go as far as to say- a scam!.. I am fair/light and I purchased both 1&2 palettes. I can use half the shades on both palettes to correct imperfections and color correct. I don't know why they don't just make a fair/light palette and a separate medium/dark palette. There is no way one person can use all of the shades on one of these palettes. Maybe the idea is for professional makeup artists to use in their kit on multiple people but even so, separate palettes divided into skintones would be much more useful. Will be returning.I liked this palette for about two months. Then I noticed it getting harder and harder (dry) for product to come off of palette and unto my brush. There is literally a hard film or something on top of most of these squares now. It also smells like old rancid make up now. I am a make up artist and had a client say, "EW, what smells?!". Obviously, I will not be able to use it anymore. Not cool.I bought this a while back after talking myself out of it over and over. 80 bucks is a lot of money, even for someone as big of a beauty product addict as me. It is worth it though, even though some of the colors are far too warm toned to be used for contouring, I still use them on lazy days as a quick eye color. You can cover dark under eye circles, angry hormonal zits and their fading dark reminders with just a smidge of this densely pigmented cream. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, due to the warmth of the bottom tones.This pallet offers good coverage and the green corrector shade is amazing. I wish there were more midrange neutral shades.This is a lovely palette however, I don't recommend buying this if you're only looking for a concealer or for occasional use. It also didn't do the best job hiding some of my dark spots on my face and work off quickly. I would've given it a higher rating, but for the price and rave reviews I expected it to be a bit better. I have the elf concealer palette and it covers the same amount for a fraction of the price.I own the 01 Viseart palette and I have to say it is one of the best invest, in makeup, I have made. I use this mainly for my really dark circles and it works wonders. It does not crease and it feels light wieght. I only had to use a little bit since it has very good pigmentation. This palette is also good for correcting, highlighting, and contouring. I love it. It is worth the price.I'm sure that this product is great for anyone who will be working on many different skin types but I can only use about half of the colors on myself. The bottom row is much warmer than in the pictures and shows up pretty orange. But goes on well and can cover my under eyes perfectly.I was hoping to fall in love with this product, but I didn't. This kit is extremely pigmented, which I absolutely adore; however, the darker colors are all too warm for my skin tone. They blend out orange. I only use the light yellow shade to correct my skintone under my foundation. Individuals with warmer skintones might be able to utilize this product a lot more than I have. I wish it was worth the money for me. :(I love the consistency and the thicknessI bought this online with my 20% off. I read the reviews and was so excited to have something that I could use for a concealer and a contour. I am blond hair, blue, eyed, with pale skin, I am 38 years old with very few wrinkles around my eyes. The dark circles around my eyes were my #1 concern, I played with this for hours and while I could get it to correct the circles, it just felt heavy and cakey. My #2 concern was contouring, again, the colors were fine but it just felt to heavy on my skin. I see this as being something better suited for a makeup artist but for an everyday go to product, it's not worth the price.I absolutely LOVE this concealer palette. They are so intensely pigmented. One touch of my finger or brush is all it takes to cover dark circles, redness, scars, you name it! The formula is very creamy as well, and blends like a dream.
 My only criticism is that the contour shades (bottom row) are WAY too warm to contour with. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
 However, i found a way to make it work.. Contour before foundation and do NOT blend. Then use beauty blender to pat on foundation to get a flawless, not-orange contour.
 Overall, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this item.I purchased Palette 2 earlier this year when it was the only palette available; I was sort of impressed with it and made it work, but found myself only using about 5 of the shades on a regular basis. When I saw Palette 1 was available, I ordered it immediately! Although I have only had this for a short time, I can say I have used it EVERY DAY; it really works PERFECTLY for concealing and color correcting; I purchased this explicitly because I have dark circles and under eye bags due to chronic illness and medications; I can really cover these problems up very well with this palette. The texture is really perfect; it is a very smooth, thin cream that can be covered with foundation and concealer after it dries for about 20 minutes. I have not found an equally high quality color correction/concealer palette or even single product - and believe me, I have TONS of them. It is quite expensive at $80, but I do not regret the purchase whatsoever. Also a TINY bit of this product goes a very long way; these are not thick cream consistency, but they are highly pigmented. This is one of my top 10 MUST-HAVE makeup items hands down.Was really excited to try this based on the good reviews. For the price, I thought this was going to be amazing. My intention when buying this was to correct, conceal, and contour (what this product is meant for). It did not correct my redness. The consistency was odd. It was between oily and grainy. Didn't blend as well as expected. I tried using my fingers, a brush, a damp beauty blender. It just wasn't working for me. I attempted to mix the shades on the back of my hand but the concealer just sunk right in and didn't give me a chance to mix it. Maybe mixing it on a plastic surface would have worked. Either way, I wanted this to be a one stop shop to cover all my makeup needs: conceal, correct, contour, and not be difficult to fuss with. The contour shades weren't bad. The concealers were okay. Correctors didn't work with my kind of redness. For $80, it wasn't mind blowing. Wish I loved it as much as other users.I have been eyeing this palette for a while, and with the VIB rouge sale recently I knew I had to buy it. Based on all the good reviews I really was expecting something AMAZING. This was not the case. I do have dry skin, but I heavily moisturize in the morning and use a hydrating primer: these still felt dry on my skin. I noticed through the day they almost just cracked in some places? That sounds weird but I had to keep trying to blend them out through the day and I absolutely never have this issue with makeup, and I wear makeup daily. They also felt dry in the pan, it's not like they just felt dry on the skin. I think if you have oily skin these might work well for you, but with dry skin I was SERIOUSLY unimpressed. It's also important to note that the colors are much more orange in person than they appear in that picture (I got 01 palette).
 I think the top row were definitely the creamiest, and the bronzer/contour shades I almost felt were grainy? Maybe I got a bad pan but they definitely feel GRAINY.
 Be cautious when buying. I personally wouldn't recommend this.I've been a loyal fan of the NARS radiant creamy concealer for a few years now, but was looking for some color correction concealers to mix into my routine. After coveting this palette for a few months, I finally purchased it during the November 20% off promo. And it was completely worth it. The individual NARS concealers are about $30 each and, since my tone changes seasonally, I always have to buy a new shade every few months. With this palette, It'll probably be a year or two until I buy a new concealer.
 The texture is also insanely creamy and pigmented without sitting heavily in the creases under my eyes. I am so amazed, wasn't sure it'd be worth the price, but it really is. Can't recommend this enough. Best concealer formula I've found yet.
 Only downside is that it's hard to take out in a small purse for touch ups, as it requires a brush or clean hands. Will probably keep my NARS around for going out at night.I ordered the number 1 based on the few reviews here, I have medium skin color. I search on the Internet for more reviews but there is almost none, I am surprised because the quality of this product amazing. The colors are beautiful to used as a highlighter, contour, eyeshadow, or concealer. I used the salmon and yellow colors to conceal my dark circles, it works better than NARS, I used the medium browns as a transition color eyeshadow it stays all day without creasing, the dark browns are beautiful for contouring. The ligh green gets rid of the redness around my nose immediately. The colors are creamy they slide on the skin and blend beautifully making my skin look young, a plus they stay all day. This is one of the best sets I own, I definitely recommend this product. Very versatile.I love spending time researching, buying and using makeup and skin care products; I detest spending the time to write reviews. Well here I am writing a review for the Viseart Concealer Palette 01 (with the pale green in it). I had to. It is worth every cent I paid for it. I have 5 criteria when I review a product. 1. Appearance - the packaging is simple and the concealers are housed in an good quality acrylic palette. The concealers looked fresh and inviting to use. (+1*) 2. Smell - there is no discernible odor with these cream concealers (+1*). 3. Accuracy of Product Claim - every little bit of these concealers matter because with a few tiny dabs and a 35 year old dark scar seemingly disappeared. Shades are easily blendable. Product blends easily. Coverage is the best I have ever experienced. No cake face with this stuff. (+1*). 4. Application & Removal - very easy to apply and get desired results whether it be lighter or heavier coverage. Removes easily with regular skin cleansing routine. 5. Overall value - Yes! $80 seems steep but this will last you a long while. These concealers definitely conceals, covers, camouflages, contours. I love trying new products and most that I've tried are mediocre and can easily be compared to other brands. Viseart is not an easy comparison to match.

For 10 years I've looked for a concealer that actually conceals without looking caked on and one that lasts all day. I love having the options of so many colors in one palette -allows for great custom blend. And really ...BARELY use any product to cover my circles, blends beautifully and doesn't crease or dry my skin. I have 1 of the eyeshadow palettes and plan on investing in all their palettes. The quality isHmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face.

Not sure if i'll repurchase though, because of the price tag haha.I really like this palette. For me, it works. A lot of cream concealer palettes I get dry out really easily. I usually have to use my Farsali oil to hydrate them so I can apply them easily. But this palette never dries! The colors work really really well for me. They blend so beautifully. The bronzer concealers are the best. It's so hard to find cream bronzers that work for your skin and blend easily. It doesn't look muddy like other cream bronzers. The only thing that bothers me is that I wish they had larger quantities of the concealer for the price. They are rather small. But for the variety you get, I guess it's okay. I've bought it twice, and once I run out I will probably do so again.This is confusing and I may even go as far as to say- a scam!.. I am fair/light and I purchased both 1&2 palettes. I can use half the shades on both palettes to correct imperfections and color correct. I don't know why they don't just make a fair/light palette and a separate medium/dark palette. There is no way one person can use all of the shades on one of these palettes. Maybe the idea is for professional makeup artists to use in their kit on multiple people but even so, separate palettes divided into skintones would be much more useful. Will be returning.I liked this palette for about two months. Then I noticed it getting harder and harder (dry) for product to come off of palette and unto my brush. There is literally a hard film or something on top of most of these squares now. It also smells like old rancid make up now. I am a make up artist and had a client say, "EW, what smells?!". Obviously, I will not be able to use it anymore. Not cool.I bought this a while back after talking myself out of it over and over. 80 bucks is a lot of money, even for someone as big of a beauty product addict as me. It is worth it though, even though some of the colors are far too warm toned to be used for contouring, I still use them on lazy days as a quick eye color. You can cover dark under eye circles, angry hormonal zits and their fading dark reminders with just a smidge of this densely pigmented cream. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, due to the warmth of the bottom tones.This pallet offers good coverage and the green corrector shade is amazing. I wish there were more midrange neutral shades.This is a lovely palette however, I don't recommend buying this if you're only looking for a concealer or for occasional use. It also didn't do the best job hiding some of my dark spots on my face and work off quickly. I would've given it a higher rating, but for the price and rave reviews I expected it to be a bit better. I have the elf concealer palette and it covers the same amount for a fraction of the price.I own the 01 Viseart palette and I have to say it is one of the best invest, in makeup, I have made. I use this mainly for my really dark circles and it works wonders. It does not crease and it feels light wieght. I only had to use a little bit since it has very good pigmentation. This palette is also good for correcting, highlighting, and contouring. I love it. It is worth the price.I'm sure that this product is great for anyone who will be working on many different skin types but I can only use about half of the colors on myself. The bottom row is much warmer than in the pictures and shows up pretty orange. But goes on well and can cover my under eyes perfectly.I was hoping to fall in love with this product, but I didn't. This kit is extremely pigmented, which I absolutely adore; however, the darker colors are all too warm for my skin tone. They blend out orange. I only use the light yellow shade to correct my skintone under my foundation. Individuals with warmer skintones might be able to utilize this product a lot more than I have. I wish it was worth the money for me. :(I love the consistency and the thicknessI bought this online with my 20% off. I read the reviews and was so excited to have something that I could use for a concealer and a contour. I am blond hair, blue, eyed, with pale skin, I am 38 years old with very few wrinkles around my eyes. The dark circles around my eyes were my #1 concern, I played with this for hours and while I could get it to correct the circles, it just felt heavy and cakey. My #2 concern was contouring, again, the colors were fine but it just felt to heavy on my skin. I see this as being something better suited for a makeup artist but for an everyday go to product, it's not worth the price.I absolutely LOVE this concealer palette. They are so intensely pigmented. One touch of my finger or brush is all it takes to cover dark circles, redness, scars, you name it! The formula is very creamy as well, and blends like a dream.
 My only criticism is that the contour shades (bottom row) are WAY too warm to contour with. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
 However, i found a way to make it work.. Contour before foundation and do NOT blend. Then use beauty blender to pat on foundation to get a flawless, not-orange contour.
 Overall, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this item.I purchased Palette 2 earlier this year when it was the only palette available; I was sort of impressed with it and made it work, but found myself only using about 5 of the shades on a regular basis. When I saw Palette 1 was available, I ordered it immediately! Although I have only had this for a short time, I can say I have used it EVERY DAY; it really works PERFECTLY for concealing and color correcting; I purchased this explicitly because I have dark circles and under eye bags due to chronic illness and medications; I can really cover these problems up very well with this palette. The texture is really perfect; it is a very smooth, thin cream that can be covered with foundation and concealer after it dries for about 20 minutes. I have not found an equally high quality color correction/concealer palette or even single product - and believe me, I have TONS of them. It is quite expensive at $80, but I do not regret the purchase whatsoever. Also a TINY bit of this product goes a very long way; these are not thick cream consistency, but they are highly pigmented. This is one of my top 10 MUST-HAVE makeup items hands down.Was really excited to try this based on the good reviews. For the price, I thought this was going to be amazing. My intention when buying this was to correct, conceal, and contour (what this product is meant for). It did not correct my redness. The consistency was odd. It was between oily and grainy. Didn't blend as well as expected. I tried using my fingers, a brush, a damp beauty blender. It just wasn't working for me. I attempted to mix the shades on the back of my hand but the concealer just sunk right in and didn't give me a chance to mix it. Maybe mixing it on a plastic surface would have worked. Either way, I wanted this to be a one stop shop to cover all my makeup needs: conceal, correct, contour, and not be difficult to fuss with. The contour shades weren't bad. The concealers were okay. Correctors didn't work with my kind of redness. For $80, it wasn't mind blowing. Wish I loved it as much as other users.I have been eyeing this palette for a while, and with the VIB rouge sale recently I knew I had to buy it. Based on all the good reviews I really was expecting something AMAZING. This was not the case. I do have dry skin, but I heavily moisturize in the morning and use a hydrating primer: these still felt dry on my skin. I noticed through the day they almost just cracked in some places? That sounds weird but I had to keep trying to blend them out through the day and I absolutely never have this issue with makeup, and I wear makeup daily. They also felt dry in the pan, it's not like they just felt dry on the skin. I think if you have oily skin these might work well for you, but with dry skin I was SERIOUSLY unimpressed. It's also important to note that the colors are much more orange in person than they appear in that picture (I got 01 palette).
 I think the top row were definitely the creamiest, and the bronzer/contour shades I almost felt were grainy? Maybe I got a bad pan but they definitely feel GRAINY.
 Be cautious when buying. I personally wouldn't recommend this.I've been a loyal fan of the NARS radiant creamy concealer for a few years now, but was looking for some color correction concealers to mix into my routine. After coveting this palette for a few months, I finally purchased it during the November 20% off promo. And it was completely worth it. The individual NARS concealers are about $30 each and, since my tone changes seasonally, I always have to buy a new shade every few months. With this palette, It'll probably be a year or two until I buy a new concealer.
 The texture is also insanely creamy and pigmented without sitting heavily in the creases under my eyes. I am so amazed, wasn't sure it'd be worth the price, but it really is. Can't recommend this enough. Best concealer formula I've found yet.
 Only downside is that it's hard to take out in a small purse for touch ups, as it requires a brush or clean hands. Will probably keep my NARS around for going out at night.I ordered the number 1 based on the few reviews here, I have medium skin color. I search on the Internet for more reviews but there is almost none, I am surprised because the quality of this product amazing. The colors are beautiful to used as a highlighter, contour, eyeshadow, or concealer. I used the salmon and yellow colors to conceal my dark circles, it works better than NARS, I used the medium browns as a transition color eyeshadow it stays all day without creasing, the dark browns are beautiful for contouring. The ligh green gets rid of the redness around my nose immediately. The colors are creamy they slide on the skin and blend beautifully making my skin look young, a plus they stay all day. This is one of the best sets I own, I definitely recommend this product. Very versatile.I love spending time researching, buying and using makeup and skin care products; I detest spending the time to write reviews. Well here I am writing a review for the Viseart Concealer Palette 01 (with the pale green in it). I had to. It is worth every cent I paid for it. I have 5 criteria when I review a product. 1. Appearance - the packaging is simple and the concealers are housed in an good quality acrylic palette. The concealers looked fresh and inviting to use. (+1*) 2. Smell - there is no discernible odor with these cream concealers (+1*). 3. Accuracy of Product Claim - every little bit of these concealers matter because with a few tiny dabs and a 35 year old dark scar seemingly disappeared. Shades are easily blendable. Product blends easily. Coverage is the best I have ever experienced. No cake face with this stuff. (+1*). 4. Application & Removal - very easy to apply and get desired results whether it be lighter or heavier coverage. Removes easily with regular skin cleansing routine. 5. Overall value - Yes! $80 seems steep but this will last you a long while. These concealers definitely conceals, covers, camouflages, contours. I love trying new products and most that I've tried are mediocre and can easily be compared to other brands. Viseart is not an easy comparison to match. If quality and product integrity is important to you, this is a must try.I have watched this for months. Just kept eyeing it but didn't want to spend $80 on concealer . What is wrong with me!? I should have ordered day 1. It is one of the best concealers I've EVER tried. First, you get a good amount of product for the money . it goes on like butter, very smooth . It also blends seamlessly . It has a great variety of colors where you can mixThe key to finding a good shade to conceal with this is not being afraid to mix colors. I added just a tad of the red hue to the peachy pink and bam- totally covered my bluish under eye circles. I'm very pale, so the red scared me but I read up on color theory and how to cancel out certain tones and this palette is great for that if you play with it. I think I will get some versatility from this.I have purple pigmentation under my eyes (thanks Mom) and 95% of concealers won't cut it for me. Not Dior, not MUFE, not Kat Von D. I have been using Amazing Cosmetics' concealer for several years and it has been doing a decent job. However, the flaws are that it creases heavily and one tube costs $40; because I tan at times, I need 2-3 shades to match my skintone. Until now.
 I've been eyeing this palette for quite some time, and the spectrum of colors first piqued my interest. It has a greenish corrector as well as 7 peach-hued shades varying from very fair porcelain shade to dark tan, so I'll be able to use this year round (yay!). I'm planning on using the dark tans for contouring. I tried a swatch of them on my hand just now and even they are pigmented as the lighter colors, so a little will go a long way.
 $80 is expensive, yes, but if you are in need of several concealers at once, or if you have very pigmented undereye areas, this is well worth the investment. I wish I had known this all before I purchased the Anastasia contouring kit (horrid) and more concealer!
 If you give this a try, you will not be disappointed.I have the #2 conceal/contour palette. As a concealer it's great. (A little too red for contouring). It's noticeably better quality than most concealers I've tried and it better be for $80! Only weird thing is it's very affected by the weather. If there's any humidity, the palette will have droplets of water on it and will be too creamy consistency. if it's dry the colors will be extremely dry verging on chalky which is harder to work with on already dry skin. Overall very happy with it though. The coverage for under eye circles is excellent since you can custom mix the colors. fun too!Love the colors. Great tones and consistency. Doesn't cake up and greatCoverage. I'm very very fair skin, I use the red tones for my dark circles and the light colors to highlight and conceal. There's no reason this palette has less than 5 stars; unless you pick the wrong palette for your skin tone/color :)I have olive tones in my complexion, chronic dark circles, and work 12 hour shifts. For 10 years I've looked for a concealer that actually conceals without looking caked on and one that lasts all day. I love having the options of so many colors in one palette -allows for great custom blend. And really ...BARELY use any product to cover my circles, blends beautifully and doesn't crease or dry my skin. I have 1 of the eyeshadow palettes and plan on investing in all their palettes. The quality isI thought the MUF camouflage palette # 5 was really good, but in comparison, this palette is better both in quality and price point. It's very creamy, emollient and I need just a touch (and I mean a light touch) for coverage. I need it to tone down redness (neutralize) and highlight. This does a beautiful job without streakiness or tugging. My skin tone ranges from a light beige to medium beige ( MUF face & body makeup # 32 or # 34); the colours in this palette is perfect.I love how blendable this concealer is as I can gently layer on colour or shade over shade. I've noticed larger pores are developing in certain areas around my nose and cheek area (it's age related) and the concealers help to cover up and make my skin look smoother.I've researched this prior to purchasing and there were comments on blogs and videos about the packaging being a bit on the cheap side. I must have the new packaging as the plastic cover and case looks and feels sturdy and substantial. It's quite compact ( just a little larger than the palm of my hand) and very portable, Ease of use, blendable, good coverage, the right colour range, sturdy packaging, portable and good value for my money, speaks of a quality product in my view.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better. I guess my skin condition wasn't great when i first used it lol. I personally find it easier to blend with a sponge rather than a brush or patting it down with a finger.

The bronzer concealers are the best. It's so hard to find cream bronzers that work for your skin and blend easily. It doesn't look muddy like other cream bronzers. The only thing that bothers me is that I wish they had larger quantities of the concealer for the price. They are rather small. But for the variety you get, I guess it's okay. I've bought it twice, and once I run out I will probably do so again.This is confusing and I may even go as far as to say- a scam!.. I am fair/light and I purchased both 1&2 palettes. I can use half the shades on both palettes to correct imperfections and color correct. I don't know why they don't just make a fair/light palette and a separate medium/dark palette. There is no way one person can use all of the shades on one of these palettes. Maybe the idea is for professional makeup artists to use in their kit on multiple people but even so, separate palettes divided into skintones would be much more useful. Will be returning.I liked this palette for about two months. Then I noticed it getting harder and harder (dry) for product to come off of palette and unto my brush. There is literally a hard film or something on top of most of these squares now. It also smells like old rancid make up now. I am a make up artist and had a client say, "EW, what smells?!". Obviously, I will not be able to use it anymore. Not cool.I bought this a while back after talking myself out of it over and over. 80 bucks is a lot of money, even for someone as big of a beauty product addict as me. It is worth it though, even though some of the colors are far too warm toned to be used for contouring, I still use them on lazy days as a quick eye color. You can cover dark under eye circles, angry hormonal zits and their fading dark reminders with just a smidge of this densely pigmented cream. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, due to the warmth of the bottom tones.This pallet offers good coverage and the green corrector shade is amazing. I wish there were more midrange neutral shades.This is a lovely palette however, I don't recommend buying this if you're only looking for a concealer or for occasional use. It also didn't do the best job hiding some of my dark spots on my face and work off quickly. I would've given it a higher rating, but for the price and rave reviews I expected it to be a bit better. I have the elf concealer palette and it covers the same amount for a fraction of the price.I own the 01 Viseart palette and I have to say it is one of the best invest, in makeup, I have made. I use this mainly for my really dark circles and it works wonders. It does not crease and it feels light wieght. I only had to use a little bit since it has very good pigmentation. This palette is also good for correcting, highlighting, and contouring. I love it. It is worth the price.I'm sure that this product is great for anyone who will be working on many different skin types but I can only use about half of the colors on myself. The bottom row is much warmer than in the pictures and shows up pretty orange. But goes on well and can cover my under eyes perfectly.I was hoping to fall in love with this product, but I didn't. This kit is extremely pigmented, which I absolutely adore; however, the darker colors are all too warm for my skin tone. They blend out orange. I only use the light yellow shade to correct my skintone under my foundation. Individuals with warmer skintones might be able to utilize this product a lot more than I have. I wish it was worth the money for me. :(I love the consistency and the thicknessI bought this online with my 20% off. I read the reviews and was so excited to have something that I could use for a concealer and a contour. I am blond hair, blue, eyed, with pale skin, I am 38 years old with very few wrinkles around my eyes. The dark circles around my eyes were my #1 concern, I played with this for hours and while I could get it to correct the circles, it just felt heavy and cakey. My #2 concern was contouring, again, the colors were fine but it just felt to heavy on my skin. I see this as being something better suited for a makeup artist but for an everyday go to product, it's not worth the price.I absolutely LOVE this concealer palette. They are so intensely pigmented. One touch of my finger or brush is all it takes to cover dark circles, redness, scars, you name it! The formula is very creamy as well, and blends like a dream.
 My only criticism is that the contour shades (bottom row) are WAY too warm to contour with. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
 However, i found a way to make it work.. Contour before foundation and do NOT blend. Then use beauty blender to pat on foundation to get a flawless, not-orange contour.
 Overall, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this item.I purchased Palette 2 earlier this year when it was the only palette available; I was sort of impressed with it and made it work, but found myself only using about 5 of the shades on a regular basis. When I saw Palette 1 was available, I ordered it immediately! Although I have only had this for a short time, I can say I have used it EVERY DAY; it really works PERFECTLY for concealing and color correcting; I purchased this explicitly because I have dark circles and under eye bags due to chronic illness and medications; I can really cover these problems up very well with this palette. The texture is really perfect; it is a very smooth, thin cream that can be covered with foundation and concealer after it dries for about 20 minutes. I have not found an equally high quality color correction/concealer palette or even single product - and believe me, I have TONS of them. It is quite expensive at $80, but I do not regret the purchase whatsoever. Also a TINY bit of this product goes a very long way; these are not thick cream consistency, but they are highly pigmented. This is one of my top 10 MUST-HAVE makeup items hands down.Was really excited to try this based on the good reviews. For the price, I thought this was going to be amazing. My intention when buying this was to correct, conceal, and contour (what this product is meant for). It did not correct my redness. The consistency was odd. It was between oily and grainy. Didn't blend as well as expected. I tried using my fingers, a brush, a damp beauty blender. It just wasn't working for me. I attempted to mix the shades on the back of my hand but the concealer just sunk right in and didn't give me a chance to mix it. Maybe mixing it on a plastic surface would have worked. Either way, I wanted this to be a one stop shop to cover all my makeup needs: conceal, correct, contour, and not be difficult to fuss with. The contour shades weren't bad. The concealers were okay. Correctors didn't work with my kind of redness. For $80, it wasn't mind blowing. Wish I loved it as much as other users.I have been eyeing this palette for a while, and with the VIB rouge sale recently I knew I had to buy it. Based on all the good reviews I really was expecting something AMAZING. This was not the case. I do have dry skin, but I heavily moisturize in the morning and use a hydrating primer: these still felt dry on my skin. I noticed through the day they almost just cracked in some places? That sounds weird but I had to keep trying to blend them out through the day and I absolutely never have this issue with makeup, and I wear makeup daily. They also felt dry in the pan, it's not like they just felt dry on the skin. I think if you have oily skin these might work well for you, but with dry skin I was SERIOUSLY unimpressed. It's also important to note that the colors are much more orange in person than they appear in that picture (I got 01 palette).
 I think the top row were definitely the creamiest, and the bronzer/contour shades I almost felt were grainy? Maybe I got a bad pan but they definitely feel GRAINY.
 Be cautious when buying. I personally wouldn't recommend this.I've been a loyal fan of the NARS radiant creamy concealer for a few years now, but was looking for some color correction concealers to mix into my routine. After coveting this palette for a few months, I finally purchased it during the November 20% off promo. And it was completely worth it. The individual NARS concealers are about $30 each and, since my tone changes seasonally, I always have to buy a new shade every few months. With this palette, It'll probably be a year or two until I buy a new concealer.
 The texture is also insanely creamy and pigmented without sitting heavily in the creases under my eyes. I am so amazed, wasn't sure it'd be worth the price, but it really is. Can't recommend this enough. Best concealer formula I've found yet.
 Only downside is that it's hard to take out in a small purse for touch ups, as it requires a brush or clean hands. Will probably keep my NARS around for going out at night.I ordered the number 1 based on the few reviews here, I have medium skin color. I search on the Internet for more reviews but there is almost none, I am surprised because the quality of this product amazing. The colors are beautiful to used as a highlighter, contour, eyeshadow, or concealer. I used the salmon and yellow colors to conceal my dark circles, it works better than NARS, I used the medium browns as a transition color eyeshadow it stays all day without creasing, the dark browns are beautiful for contouring. The ligh green gets rid of the redness around my nose immediately. The colors are creamy they slide on the skin and blend beautifully making my skin look young, a plus they stay all day. This is one of the best sets I own, I definitely recommend this product. Very versatile.I love spending time researching, buying and using makeup and skin care products; I detest spending the time to write reviews. Well here I am writing a review for the Viseart Concealer Palette 01 (with the pale green in it). I had to. It is worth every cent I paid for it. I have 5 criteria when I review a product. 1. Appearance - the packaging is simple and the concealers are housed in an good quality acrylic palette. The concealers looked fresh and inviting to use. (+1*) 2. Smell - there is no discernible odor with these cream concealers (+1*). 3. Accuracy of Product Claim - every little bit of these concealers matter because with a few tiny dabs and a 35 year old dark scar seemingly disappeared. Shades are easily blendable. Product blends easily. Coverage is the best I have ever experienced. No cake face with this stuff. (+1*). 4. Application & Removal - very easy to apply and get desired results whether it be lighter or heavier coverage. Removes easily with regular skin cleansing routine. 5. Overall value - Yes! $80 seems steep but this will last you a long while. These concealers definitely conceals, covers, camouflages, contours. I love trying new products and most that I've tried are mediocre and can easily be compared to other brands. Viseart is not an easy comparison to match. If quality and product integrity is important to you, this is a must try.I have watched this for months. Just kept eyeing it but didn't want to spend $80 on concealer . What is wrong with me!? I should have ordered day 1. It is one of the best concealers I've EVER tried. First, you get a good amount of product for the money . it goes on like butter, very smooth . It also blends seamlessly . It has a great variety of colors where you can mixThe key to finding a good shade to conceal with this is not being afraid to mix colors. I added just a tad of the red hue to the peachy pink and bam- totally covered my bluish under eye circles. I'm very pale, so the red scared me but I read up on color theory and how to cancel out certain tones and this palette is great for that if you play with it. I think I will get some versatility from this.I have purple pigmentation under my eyes (thanks Mom) and 95% of concealers won't cut it for me. Not Dior, not MUFE, not Kat Von D. I have been using Amazing Cosmetics' concealer for several years and it has been doing a decent job. However, the flaws are that it creases heavily and one tube costs $40; because I tan at times, I need 2-3 shades to match my skintone. Until now.
 I've been eyeing this palette for quite some time, and the spectrum of colors first piqued my interest. It has a greenish corrector as well as 7 peach-hued shades varying from very fair porcelain shade to dark tan, so I'll be able to use this year round (yay!). I'm planning on using the dark tans for contouring. I tried a swatch of them on my hand just now and even they are pigmented as the lighter colors, so a little will go a long way.
 $80 is expensive, yes, but if you are in need of several concealers at once, or if you have very pigmented undereye areas, this is well worth the investment. I wish I had known this all before I purchased the Anastasia contouring kit (horrid) and more concealer!
 If you give this a try, you will not be disappointed.I have the #2 conceal/contour palette. As a concealer it's great. (A little too red for contouring). It's noticeably better quality than most concealers I've tried and it better be for $80! Only weird thing is it's very affected by the weather. If there's any humidity, the palette will have droplets of water on it and will be too creamy consistency. if it's dry the colors will be extremely dry verging on chalky which is harder to work with on already dry skin. Overall very happy with it though. The coverage for under eye circles is excellent since you can custom mix the colors. fun too!Love the colors. Great tones and consistency. Doesn't cake up and greatCoverage. I'm very very fair skin, I use the red tones for my dark circles and the light colors to highlight and conceal. There's no reason this palette has less than 5 stars; unless you pick the wrong palette for your skin tone/color :)I have olive tones in my complexion, chronic dark circles, and work 12 hour shifts. For 10 years I've looked for a concealer that actually conceals without looking caked on and one that lasts all day. I love having the options of so many colors in one palette -allows for great custom blend. And really ...BARELY use any product to cover my circles, blends beautifully and doesn't crease or dry my skin. I have 1 of the eyeshadow palettes and plan on investing in all their palettes. The quality isI thought the MUF camouflage palette # 5 was really good, but in comparison, this palette is better both in quality and price point. It's very creamy, emollient and I need just a touch (and I mean a light touch) for coverage. I need it to tone down redness (neutralize) and highlight. This does a beautiful job without streakiness or tugging. My skin tone ranges from a light beige to medium beige ( MUF face & body makeup # 32 or # 34); the colours in this palette is perfect.I love how blendable this concealer is as I can gently layer on colour or shade over shade. I've noticed larger pores are developing in certain areas around my nose and cheek area (it's age related) and the concealers help to cover up and make my skin look smoother.I've researched this prior to purchasing and there were comments on blogs and videos about the packaging being a bit on the cheap side. I must have the new packaging as the plastic cover and case looks and feels sturdy and substantial. It's quite compact ( just a little larger than the palm of my hand) and very portable, Ease of use, blendable, good coverage, the right colour range, sturdy packaging, portable and good value for my money, speaks of a quality product in my view.This palette is absolutely wonderful. It's creamy, blendable, and most of all DOES NOT CREASE!!! It's very expensive but having such a rainbow of colors in one palette, you can't go wrong honestly. I got the 01 palette. I have a bit of redness on my cheeks and the green works so well at correcting it. I really love this palette. Def worth every penny. NO CREASING HERE!!If you are looking to just use this palette to correct and conceal, then this product is definitely for you. This palette is creamy, easy to work with, and blends seamlessly. The packaging is compact and durable. The only thing I did not like is that the contour colors in this palette run on the warm side and have reddish tones (more like a bronzer). I personally like a grey-toned or neutral-toned brown to contour with.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better. I guess my skin condition wasn't great when i first used it lol. I personally find it easier to blend with a sponge rather than a brush or patting it down with a finger. 
 I got palette 01, the range is quite versatile. from the light to the dark, i can pretty much fully utilise most of the colours so it wasn't a waste. Not sure if i'll repurchase though, because of the price tag haha.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning.

I can use half the shades on both palettes to correct imperfections and color correct. I don't know why they don't just make a fair/light palette and a separate medium/dark palette. There is no way one person can use all of the shades on one of these palettes. Maybe the idea is for professional makeup artists to use in their kit on multiple people but even so, separate palettes divided into skintones would be much more useful. Will be returning.I liked this palette for about two months. Then I noticed it getting harder and harder (dry) for product to come off of palette and unto my brush. There is literally a hard film or something on top of most of these squares now. It also smells like old rancid make up now. I am a make up artist and had a client say, "EW, what smells?!". Obviously, I will not be able to use it anymore. Not cool.I bought this a while back after talking myself out of it over and over. 80 bucks is a lot of money, even for someone as big of a beauty product addict as me. It is worth it though, even though some of the colors are far too warm toned to be used for contouring, I still use them on lazy days as a quick eye color. You can cover dark under eye circles, angry hormonal zits and their fading dark reminders with just a smidge of this densely pigmented cream. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, due to the warmth of the bottom tones.This pallet offers good coverage and the green corrector shade is amazing. I wish there were more midrange neutral shades.This is a lovely palette however, I don't recommend buying this if you're only looking for a concealer or for occasional use. It also didn't do the best job hiding some of my dark spots on my face and work off quickly. I would've given it a higher rating, but for the price and rave reviews I expected it to be a bit better. I have the elf concealer palette and it covers the same amount for a fraction of the price.I own the 01 Viseart palette and I have to say it is one of the best invest, in makeup, I have made. I use this mainly for my really dark circles and it works wonders. It does not crease and it feels light wieght. I only had to use a little bit since it has very good pigmentation. This palette is also good for correcting, highlighting, and contouring. I love it. It is worth the price.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better. I guess my skin condition wasn't great when i first used it lol. I personally find it easier to blend with a sponge rather than a brush or patting it down with a finger. 
 I got palette 01, the range is quite versatile. from the light to the dark, i can pretty much fully utilise most of the colours so it wasn't a waste. Not sure if i'll repurchase though, because of the price tag haha.I really like this palette. For me, it works. A lot of cream concealer palettes I get dry out really easily. I usually have to use my Farsali oil to hydrate them so I can apply them easily. But this palette never dries! The colors work really really well for me. They blend so beautifully. The bronzer concealers are the best. It's so hard to find cream bronzers that work for your skin and blend easily. It doesn't look muddy like other cream bronzers.

I am blond hair, blue, eyed, with pale skin, I am 38 years old with very few wrinkles around my eyes.

One touch of my finger or brush is all it takes to cover dark circles, redness, scars, you name it! The formula is very creamy as well, and blends like a dream.
 My only criticism is that the contour shades (bottom row) are WAY too warm to contour with. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
 However, i found a way to make it work.. Contour before foundation and do NOT blend. Then use beauty blender to pat on foundation to get a flawless, not-orange contour.

 Overall, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this item.I purchased Palette 2 earlier this year when it was the only palette available; I was sort of impressed with it and made it work, but found myself only using about 5 of the shades on a regular basis. When I saw Palette 1 was available, I ordered it immediately! Although I have only had this for a short time, I can say I have used it EVERY DAY; it really works PERFECTLY for concealing and color correcting; I purchased this explicitly because I have dark circles and under eye bags due to chronic illness and medications; I can really cover these problems up very well with this palette. The texture is really perfect; it is a very smooth, thin cream that can be covered with foundation and concealer after it dries for about 20 minutes. I have not found an equally high quality color correction/concealer palette or even single product - and believe me, I have TONS of them. It is quite expensive at $80, but I do not regret the purchase whatsoever. Also a TINY bit of this product goes a very long way; these are not thick cream consistency, but they are highly pigmented. This is one of my top 10 MUST-HAVE makeup items hands down.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better. I guess my skin condition wasn't great when i first used it lol. I personally find it easier to blend with a sponge rather than a brush or patting it down with a finger. 
 I got palette 01, the range is quite versatile. from the light to the dark, i can pretty much fully utilise most of the colours so it wasn't a waste. Not sure if i'll repurchase though, because of the price tag haha.I really like this palette. For me, it works. A lot of cream concealer palettes I get dry out really easily. I usually have to use my Farsali oil to hydrate them so I can apply them easily. But this palette never dries! The colors work really really well for me. They blend so beautifully. The bronzer concealers are the best. It's so hard to find cream bronzers that work for your skin and blend easily. It doesn't look muddy like other cream bronzers. The only thing that bothers me is that I wish they had larger quantities of the concealer for the price. They are rather small. But for the variety you get, I guess it's okay. I've bought it twice, and once I run out I will probably do so again.This is confusing and I may even go as far as to say- a scam!.. I am fair/light and I purchased both 1&2 palettes. I can use half the shades on both palettes to correct imperfections and color correct. I don't know why they don't just make a fair/light palette and a separate medium/dark palette. There is no way one person can use all of the shades on one of these palettes. Maybe the idea is for professional makeup artists to use in their kit on multiple people but even so, separate palettes divided into skintones would be much more useful. Will be returning.I liked this palette for about two months. Then I noticed it getting harder and harder (dry) for product to come off of palette and unto my brush. There is literally a hard film or something on top of most of these squares now. It also smells like old rancid make up now. I am a make up artist and had a client say, "EW, what smells?!". Obviously, I will not be able to use it anymore. Not cool.I bought this a while back after talking myself out of it over and over. 80 bucks is a lot of money, even for someone as big of a beauty product addict as me. It is worth it though, even though some of the colors are far too warm toned to be used for contouring, I still use them on lazy days as a quick eye color. You can cover dark under eye circles, angry hormonal zits and their fading dark reminders with just a smidge of this densely pigmented cream. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, due to the warmth of the bottom tones.This pallet offers good coverage and the green corrector shade is amazing. I wish there were more midrange neutral shades.This is a lovely palette however, I don't recommend buying this if you're only looking for a concealer or for occasional use. It also didn't do the best job hiding some of my dark spots on my face and work off quickly. I would've given it a higher rating, but for the price and rave reviews I expected it to be a bit better. I have the elf concealer palette and it covers the same amount for a fraction of the price.I own the 01 Viseart palette and I have to say it is one of the best invest, in makeup, I have made. I use this mainly for my really dark circles and it works wonders. It does not crease and it feels light wieght. I only had to use a little bit since it has very good pigmentation. This palette is also good for correcting, highlighting, and contouring. I love it. It is worth the price.I'm sure that this product is great for anyone who will be working on many different skin types but I can only use about half of the colors on myself. The bottom row is much warmer than in the pictures and shows up pretty orange. But goes on well and can cover my under eyes perfectly.I was hoping to fall in love with this product, but I didn't. This kit is extremely pigmented, which I absolutely adore; however, the darker colors are all too warm for my skin tone. They blend out orange. I only use the light yellow shade to correct my skintone under my foundation. Individuals with warmer skintones might be able to utilize this product a lot more than I have. I wish it was worth the money for me. :(I love the consistency and the thicknessI bought this online with my 20% off. I read the reviews and was so excited to have something that I could use for a concealer and a contour. I am blond hair, blue, eyed, with pale skin, I am 38 years old with very few wrinkles around my eyes. The dark circles around my eyes were my #1 concern, I played with this for hours and while I could get it to correct the circles, it just felt heavy and cakey. My #2 concern was contouring, again, the colors were fine but it just felt to heavy on my skin. I see this as being something better suited for a makeup artist but for an everyday go to product, it's not worth the price.I absolutely LOVE this concealer palette. They are so intensely pigmented. One touch of my finger or brush is all it takes to cover dark circles, redness, scars, you name it! The formula is very creamy as well, and blends like a dream.
 My only criticism is that the contour shades (bottom row) are WAY too warm to contour with. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
 However, i found a way to make it work.. Contour before foundation and do NOT blend. Then use beauty blender to pat on foundation to get a flawless, not-orange contour.
 Overall, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this item.I purchased Palette 2 earlier this year when it was the only palette available; I was sort of impressed with it and made it work, but found myself only using about 5 of the shades on a regular basis. When I saw Palette 1 was available, I ordered it immediately! Although I have only had this for a short time, I can say I have used it EVERY DAY; it really works PERFECTLY for concealing and color correcting; I purchased this explicitly because I have dark circles and under eye bags due to chronic illness and medications; I can really cover these problems up very well with this palette. The texture is really perfect; it is a very smooth, thin cream that can be covered with foundation and concealer after it dries for about 20 minutes. I have not found an equally high quality color correction/concealer palette or even single product - and believe me, I have TONS of them. It is quite expensive at $80, but I do not regret the purchase whatsoever. Also a TINY bit of this product goes a very long way; these are not thick cream consistency, but they are highly pigmented. This is one of my top 10 MUST-HAVE makeup items hands down.Was really excited to try this based on the good reviews. For the price, I thought this was going to be amazing. My intention when buying this was to correct, conceal, and contour (what this product is meant for). It did not correct my redness. The consistency was odd. It was between oily and grainy. Didn't blend as well as expected. I tried using my fingers, a brush, a damp beauty blender. It just wasn't working for me. I attempted to mix the shades on the back of my hand but the concealer just sunk right in and didn't give me a chance to mix it. Maybe mixing it on a plastic surface would have worked. Either way, I wanted this to be a one stop shop to cover all my makeup needs: conceal, correct, contour, and not be difficult to fuss with. The contour shades weren't bad. The concealers were okay. Correctors didn't work with my kind of redness. For $80, it wasn't mind blowing. Wish I loved it as much as other users.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning.

Based on all the good reviews I really was expecting something AMAZING. This was not the case. I do have dry skin, but I heavily moisturize in the morning and use a hydrating primer: these still felt dry on my skin. I noticed through the day they almost just cracked in some places? That sounds weird but I had to keep trying to blend them out through the day and I absolutely never have this issue with makeup, and I wear makeup daily. They also felt dry in the pan, it's not like they just felt dry on the skin. I think if you have oily skin these might work well for you, but with dry skin I was SERIOUSLY unimpressed. It's also important to note that the colors are much more orange in person than they appear in that picture (I got 01 palette).
 I think the top row were definitely the creamiest, and the bronzer/contour shades I almost felt were grainy? Maybe I got a bad pan but they definitely feel GRAINY.

 Be cautious when buying. I personally wouldn't recommend this.I've been a loyal fan of the NARS radiant creamy concealer for a few years now, but was looking for some color correction concealers to mix into my routine. After coveting this palette for a few months, I finally purchased it during the November 20% off promo. And it was completely worth it. The individual NARS concealers are about $30 each and, since my tone changes seasonally, I always have to buy a new shade every few months. With this palette, It'll probably be a year or two until I buy a new concealer.
 The texture is also insanely creamy and pigmented without sitting heavily in the creases under my eyes. I am so amazed, wasn't sure it'd be worth the price, but it really is. Can't recommend this enough. Best concealer formula I've found yet.
 Only downside is that it's hard to take out in a small purse for touch ups, as it requires a brush or clean hands. Will probably keep my NARS around for going out at night.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better. I guess my skin condition wasn't great when i first used it lol. I personally find it easier to blend with a sponge rather than a brush or patting it down with a finger.

I attempted to mix the shades on the back of my hand but the concealer just sunk right in and didn't give me a chance to mix it. Maybe mixing it on a plastic surface would have worked. Either way, I wanted this to be a one stop shop to cover all my makeup needs: conceal, correct, contour, and not be difficult to fuss with. The contour shades weren't bad. The concealers were okay. Correctors didn't work with my kind of redness. For $80, it wasn't mind blowing. Wish I loved it as much as other users.I have been eyeing this palette for a while, and with the VIB rouge sale recently I knew I had to buy it. Based on all the good reviews I really was expecting something AMAZING. This was not the case. I do have dry skin, but I heavily moisturize in the morning and use a hydrating primer: these still felt dry on my skin. I noticed through the day they almost just cracked in some places? That sounds weird but I had to keep trying to blend them out through the day and I absolutely never have this issue with makeup, and I wear makeup daily. They also felt dry in the pan, it's not like they just felt dry on the skin. I think if you have oily skin these might work well for you, but with dry skin I was SERIOUSLY unimpressed. It's also important to note that the colors are much more orange in person than they appear in that picture (I got 01 palette).
 I think the top row were definitely the creamiest, and the bronzer/contour shades I almost felt were grainy? Maybe I got a bad pan but they definitely feel GRAINY.
 Be cautious when buying. I personally wouldn't recommend this.I've been a loyal fan of the NARS radiant creamy concealer for a few years now, but was looking for some color correction concealers to mix into my routine. After coveting this palette for a few months, I finally purchased it during the November 20% off promo. And it was completely worth it. The individual NARS concealers are about $30 each and, since my tone changes seasonally, I always have to buy a new shade every few months. With this palette, It'll probably be a year or two until I buy a new concealer.
 The texture is also insanely creamy and pigmented without sitting heavily in the creases under my eyes. I am so amazed, wasn't sure it'd be worth the price, but it really is. Can't recommend this enough. Best concealer formula I've found yet.
 Only downside is that it's hard to take out in a small purse for touch ups, as it requires a brush or clean hands. Will probably keep my NARS around for going out at night.I ordered the number 1 based on the few reviews here, I have medium skin color. I search on the Internet for more reviews but there is almost none, I am surprised because the quality of this product amazing. The colors are beautiful to used as a highlighter, contour, eyeshadow, or concealer. I used the salmon and yellow colors to conceal my dark circles, it works better than NARS, I used the medium browns as a transition color eyeshadow it stays all day without creasing, the dark browns are beautiful for contouring. The ligh green gets rid of the redness around my nose immediately. The colors are creamy they slide on the skin and blend beautifully making my skin look young, a plus they stay all day. This is one of the best sets I own, I definitely recommend this product. Very versatile.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better. I guess my skin condition wasn't great when i first used it lol. I personally find it easier to blend with a sponge rather than a brush or patting it down with a finger. 
 I got palette 01, the range is quite versatile. from the light to the dark, i can pretty much fully utilise most of the colours so it wasn't a waste. Not sure if i'll repurchase though, because of the price tag haha.I really like this palette. For me, it works. A lot of cream concealer palettes I get dry out really easily. I usually have to use my Farsali oil to hydrate them so I can apply them easily. But this palette never dries! The colors work really really well for me. They blend so beautifully. The bronzer concealers are the best. It's so hard to find cream bronzers that work for your skin and blend easily. It doesn't look muddy like other cream bronzers. The only thing that bothers me is that I wish they had larger quantities of the concealer for the price. They are rather small. But for the variety you get, I guess it's okay. I've bought it twice, and once I run out I will probably do so again.This is confusing and I may even go as far as to say- a scam!.. I am fair/light and I purchased both 1&2 palettes. I can use half the shades on both palettes to correct imperfections and color correct. I don't know why they don't just make a fair/light palette and a separate medium/dark palette. There is no way one person can use all of the shades on one of these palettes. Maybe the idea is for professional makeup artists to use in their kit on multiple people but even so, separate palettes divided into skintones would be much more useful. Will be returning.I liked this palette for about two months. Then I noticed it getting harder and harder (dry) for product to come off of palette and unto my brush. There is literally a hard film or something on top of most of these squares now. It also smells like old rancid make up now. I am a make up artist and had a client say, "EW, what smells?!". Obviously, I will not be able to use it anymore. Not cool.I bought this a while back after talking myself out of it over and over. 80 bucks is a lot of money, even for someone as big of a beauty product addict as me. It is worth it though, even though some of the colors are far too warm toned to be used for contouring, I still use them on lazy days as a quick eye color. You can cover dark under eye circles, angry hormonal zits and their fading dark reminders with just a smidge of this densely pigmented cream. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, due to the warmth of the bottom tones.This pallet offers good coverage and the green corrector shade is amazing. I wish there were more midrange neutral shades.This is a lovely palette however, I don't recommend buying this if you're only looking for a concealer or for occasional use. It also didn't do the best job hiding some of my dark spots on my face and work off quickly. I would've given it a higher rating, but for the price and rave reviews I expected it to be a bit better. I have the elf concealer palette and it covers the same amount for a fraction of the price.I own the 01 Viseart palette and I have to say it is one of the best invest, in makeup, I have made. I use this mainly for my really dark circles and it works wonders. It does not crease and it feels light wieght. I only had to use a little bit since it has very good pigmentation. This palette is also good for correcting, highlighting, and contouring. I love it. It is worth the price.I'm sure that this product is great for anyone who will be working on many different skin types but I can only use about half of the colors on myself. The bottom row is much warmer than in the pictures and shows up pretty orange. But goes on well and can cover my under eyes perfectly.I was hoping to fall in love with this product, but I didn't. This kit is extremely pigmented, which I absolutely adore; however, the darker colors are all too warm for my skin tone. They blend out orange. I only use the light yellow shade to correct my skintone under my foundation. Individuals with warmer skintones might be able to utilize this product a lot more than I have. I wish it was worth the money for me. :(I love the consistency and the thicknessI bought this online with my 20% off. I read the reviews and was so excited to have something that I could use for a concealer and a contour. I am blond hair, blue, eyed, with pale skin, I am 38 years old with very few wrinkles around my eyes. The dark circles around my eyes were my #1 concern, I played with this for hours and while I could get it to correct the circles, it just felt heavy and cakey. My #2 concern was contouring, again, the colors were fine but it just felt to heavy on my skin. I see this as being something better suited for a makeup artist but for an everyday go to product, it's not worth the price.I absolutely LOVE this concealer palette. They are so intensely pigmented. One touch of my finger or brush is all it takes to cover dark circles, redness, scars, you name it! The formula is very creamy as well, and blends like a dream.
 My only criticism is that the contour shades (bottom row) are WAY too warm to contour with. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
 However, i found a way to make it work.. Contour before foundation and do NOT blend. Then use beauty blender to pat on foundation to get a flawless, not-orange contour.
 Overall, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this item.I purchased Palette 2 earlier this year when it was the only palette available; I was sort of impressed with it and made it work, but found myself only using about 5 of the shades on a regular basis. When I saw Palette 1 was available, I ordered it immediately! Although I have only had this for a short time, I can say I have used it EVERY DAY; it really works PERFECTLY for concealing and color correcting; I purchased this explicitly because I have dark circles and under eye bags due to chronic illness and medications; I can really cover these problems up very well with this palette. The texture is really perfect; it is a very smooth, thin cream that can be covered with foundation and concealer after it dries for about 20 minutes. I have not found an equally high quality color correction/concealer palette or even single product - and believe me, I have TONS of them. It is quite expensive at $80, but I do not regret the purchase whatsoever. Also a TINY bit of this product goes a very long way; these are not thick cream consistency, but they are highly pigmented. This is one of my top 10 MUST-HAVE makeup items hands down.Was really excited to try this based on the good reviews. For the price, I thought this was going to be amazing.

Very versatile.I love spending time researching, buying and using makeup and skin care products; I detest spending the time to write reviews. Well here I am writing a review for the Viseart Concealer Palette 01 (with the pale green in it). I had to. It is worth every cent I paid for it. I have 5 criteria when I review a product. 1. Appearance - the packaging is simple and the concealers are housed in an good quality acrylic palette. The concealers looked fresh and inviting to use. (+1*) 2. Smell - there is no discernible odor with these cream concealers (+1*). 3. Accuracy of Product Claim - every little bit of these concealers matter because with a few tiny dabs and a 35 year old dark scar seemingly disappeared. Shades are easily blendable. Product blends easily. Coverage is the best I have ever experienced. No cake face with this stuff. (+1*). 4. Application & Removal - very easy to apply and get desired results whether it be lighter or heavier coverage. Removes easily with regular skin cleansing routine. 5. Overall value - Yes! $80 seems steep but this will last you a long while. These concealers definitely conceals, covers, camouflages, contours. I love trying new products and most that I've tried are mediocre and can easily be compared to other brands. Viseart is not an easy comparison to match. If quality and product integrity is important to you, this is a must try.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning.

I should have ordered day 1. It is one of the best concealers I've EVER tried. First, you get a good amount of product for the money . it goes on like butter, very smooth . It also blends seamlessly . It has a great variety of colors where you can mixHmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning.

Although I have only had this for a short time, I can say I have used it EVERY DAY; it really works PERFECTLY for concealing and color correcting; I purchased this explicitly because I have dark circles and under eye bags due to chronic illness and medications; I can really cover these problems up very well with this palette. The texture is really perfect; it is a very smooth, thin cream that can be covered with foundation and concealer after it dries for about 20 minutes. I have not found an equally high quality color correction/concealer palette or even single product - and believe me, I have TONS of them. It is quite expensive at $80, but I do not regret the purchase whatsoever. Also a TINY bit of this product goes a very long way; these are not thick cream consistency, but they are highly pigmented. This is one of my top 10 MUST-HAVE makeup items hands down.Was really excited to try this based on the good reviews. For the price, I thought this was going to be amazing. My intention when buying this was to correct, conceal, and contour (what this product is meant for). It did not correct my redness. The consistency was odd. It was between oily and grainy. Didn't blend as well as expected. I tried using my fingers, a brush, a damp beauty blender. It just wasn't working for me. I attempted to mix the shades on the back of my hand but the concealer just sunk right in and didn't give me a chance to mix it. Maybe mixing it on a plastic surface would have worked. Either way, I wanted this to be a one stop shop to cover all my makeup needs: conceal, correct, contour, and not be difficult to fuss with. The contour shades weren't bad. The concealers were okay. Correctors didn't work with my kind of redness. For $80, it wasn't mind blowing. Wish I loved it as much as other users.I have been eyeing this palette for a while, and with the VIB rouge sale recently I knew I had to buy it. Based on all the good reviews I really was expecting something AMAZING. This was not the case. I do have dry skin, but I heavily moisturize in the morning and use a hydrating primer: these still felt dry on my skin. I noticed through the day they almost just cracked in some places? That sounds weird but I had to keep trying to blend them out through the day and I absolutely never have this issue with makeup, and I wear makeup daily. They also felt dry in the pan, it's not like they just felt dry on the skin. I think if you have oily skin these might work well for you, but with dry skin I was SERIOUSLY unimpressed. It's also important to note that the colors are much more orange in person than they appear in that picture (I got 01 palette).
 I think the top row were definitely the creamiest, and the bronzer/contour shades I almost felt were grainy? Maybe I got a bad pan but they definitely feel GRAINY.
 Be cautious when buying. I personally wouldn't recommend this.I've been a loyal fan of the NARS radiant creamy concealer for a few years now, but was looking for some color correction concealers to mix into my routine. After coveting this palette for a few months, I finally purchased it during the November 20% off promo. And it was completely worth it. The individual NARS concealers are about $30 each and, since my tone changes seasonally, I always have to buy a new shade every few months. With this palette, It'll probably be a year or two until I buy a new concealer.
 The texture is also insanely creamy and pigmented without sitting heavily in the creases under my eyes. I am so amazed, wasn't sure it'd be worth the price, but it really is. Can't recommend this enough. Best concealer formula I've found yet.
 Only downside is that it's hard to take out in a small purse for touch ups, as it requires a brush or clean hands. Will probably keep my NARS around for going out at night.I ordered the number 1 based on the few reviews here, I have medium skin color. I search on the Internet for more reviews but there is almost none, I am surprised because the quality of this product amazing. The colors are beautiful to used as a highlighter, contour, eyeshadow, or concealer. I used the salmon and yellow colors to conceal my dark circles, it works better than NARS, I used the medium browns as a transition color eyeshadow it stays all day without creasing, the dark browns are beautiful for contouring. The ligh green gets rid of the redness around my nose immediately. The colors are creamy they slide on the skin and blend beautifully making my skin look young, a plus they stay all day. This is one of the best sets I own, I definitely recommend this product. Very versatile.I love spending time researching, buying and using makeup and skin care products; I detest spending the time to write reviews. Well here I am writing a review for the Viseart Concealer Palette 01 (with the pale green in it). I had to. It is worth every cent I paid for it. I have 5 criteria when I review a product. 1. Appearance - the packaging is simple and the concealers are housed in an good quality acrylic palette. The concealers looked fresh and inviting to use. (+1*) 2. Smell - there is no discernible odor with these cream concealers (+1*). 3. Accuracy of Product Claim - every little bit of these concealers matter because with a few tiny dabs and a 35 year old dark scar seemingly disappeared. Shades are easily blendable. Product blends easily. Coverage is the best I have ever experienced. No cake face with this stuff. (+1*). 4. Application & Removal - very easy to apply and get desired results whether it be lighter or heavier coverage. Removes easily with regular skin cleansing routine. 5. Overall value - Yes! $80 seems steep but this will last you a long while. These concealers definitely conceals, covers, camouflages, contours. I love trying new products and most that I've tried are mediocre and can easily be compared to other brands. Viseart is not an easy comparison to match. If quality and product integrity is important to you, this is a must try.I have watched this for months. Just kept eyeing it but didn't want to spend $80 on concealer . What is wrong with me!? I should have ordered day 1. It is one of the best concealers I've EVER tried. First, you get a good amount of product for the money . it goes on like butter, very smooth . It also blends seamlessly . It has a great variety of colors where you can mixThe key to finding a good shade to conceal with this is not being afraid to mix colors. I added just a tad of the red hue to the peachy pink and bam- totally covered my bluish under eye circles. I'm very pale, so the red scared me but I read up on color theory and how to cancel out certain tones and this palette is great for that if you play with it. I think I will get some versatility from this.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better. I guess my skin condition wasn't great when i first used it lol. I personally find it easier to blend with a sponge rather than a brush or patting it down with a finger. 
 I got palette 01, the range is quite versatile. from the light to the dark, i can pretty much fully utilise most of the colours so it wasn't a waste. Not sure if i'll repurchase though, because of the price tag haha.I really like this palette. For me, it works. A lot of cream concealer palettes I get dry out really easily. I usually have to use my Farsali oil to hydrate them so I can apply them easily. But this palette never dries! The colors work really really well for me. They blend so beautifully. The bronzer concealers are the best. It's so hard to find cream bronzers that work for your skin and blend easily. It doesn't look muddy like other cream bronzers. The only thing that bothers me is that I wish they had larger quantities of the concealer for the price. They are rather small. But for the variety you get, I guess it's okay. I've bought it twice, and once I run out I will probably do so again.This is confusing and I may even go as far as to say- a scam!.. I am fair/light and I purchased both 1&2 palettes. I can use half the shades on both palettes to correct imperfections and color correct. I don't know why they don't just make a fair/light palette and a separate medium/dark palette. There is no way one person can use all of the shades on one of these palettes. Maybe the idea is for professional makeup artists to use in their kit on multiple people but even so, separate palettes divided into skintones would be much more useful. Will be returning.I liked this palette for about two months. Then I noticed it getting harder and harder (dry) for product to come off of palette and unto my brush. There is literally a hard film or something on top of most of these squares now. It also smells like old rancid make up now. I am a make up artist and had a client say, "EW, what smells?!". Obviously, I will not be able to use it anymore. Not cool.I bought this a while back after talking myself out of it over and over. 80 bucks is a lot of money, even for someone as big of a beauty product addict as me. It is worth it though, even though some of the colors are far too warm toned to be used for contouring, I still use them on lazy days as a quick eye color. You can cover dark under eye circles, angry hormonal zits and their fading dark reminders with just a smidge of this densely pigmented cream. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, due to the warmth of the bottom tones.This pallet offers good coverage and the green corrector shade is amazing. I wish there were more midrange neutral shades.This is a lovely palette however, I don't recommend buying this if you're only looking for a concealer or for occasional use. It also didn't do the best job hiding some of my dark spots on my face and work off quickly. I would've given it a higher rating, but for the price and rave reviews I expected it to be a bit better. I have the elf concealer palette and it covers the same amount for a fraction of the price.I own the 01 Viseart palette and I have to say it is one of the best invest, in makeup, I have made. I use this mainly for my really dark circles and it works wonders. It does not crease and it feels light wieght. I only had to use a little bit since it has very good pigmentation. This palette is also good for correcting, highlighting, and contouring. I love it. It is worth the price.I'm sure that this product is great for anyone who will be working on many different skin types but I can only use about half of the colors on myself. The bottom row is much warmer than in the pictures and shows up pretty orange. But goes on well and can cover my under eyes perfectly.I was hoping to fall in love with this product, but I didn't. This kit is extremely pigmented, which I absolutely adore; however, the darker colors are all too warm for my skin tone. They blend out orange. I only use the light yellow shade to correct my skintone under my foundation. Individuals with warmer skintones might be able to utilize this product a lot more than I have. I wish it was worth the money for me. :(I love the consistency and the thicknessI bought this online with my 20% off. I read the reviews and was so excited to have something that I could use for a concealer and a contour. I am blond hair, blue, eyed, with pale skin, I am 38 years old with very few wrinkles around my eyes. The dark circles around my eyes were my #1 concern, I played with this for hours and while I could get it to correct the circles, it just felt heavy and cakey. My #2 concern was contouring, again, the colors were fine but it just felt to heavy on my skin. I see this as being something better suited for a makeup artist but for an everyday go to product, it's not worth the price.I absolutely LOVE this concealer palette. They are so intensely pigmented. One touch of my finger or brush is all it takes to cover dark circles, redness, scars, you name it! The formula is very creamy as well, and blends like a dream.
 My only criticism is that the contour shades (bottom row) are WAY too warm to contour with. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
 However, i found a way to make it work.. Contour before foundation and do NOT blend. Then use beauty blender to pat on foundation to get a flawless, not-orange contour.

I think I will get some versatility from this.I have purple pigmentation under my eyes (thanks Mom) and 95% of concealers won't cut it for me. Not Dior, not MUFE, not Kat Von D. I have been using Amazing Cosmetics' concealer for several years and it has been doing a decent job. However, the flaws are that it creases heavily and one tube costs $40; because I tan at times, I need 2-3 shades to match my skintone. Until now.
 I've been eyeing this palette for quite some time, and the spectrum of colors first piqued my interest. It has a greenish corrector as well as 7 peach-hued shades varying from very fair porcelain shade to dark tan, so I'll be able to use this year round (yay!). I'm planning on using the dark tans for contouring. I tried a swatch of them on my hand just now and even they are pigmented as the lighter colors, so a little will go a long way.
 $80 is expensive, yes, but if you are in need of several concealers at once, or if you have very pigmented undereye areas, this is well worth the investment. I wish I had known this all before I purchased the Anastasia contouring kit (horrid) and more concealer!
 If you give this a try, you will not be disappointed.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning.

I have been using Amazing Cosmetics' concealer for several years and it has been doing a decent job. However, the flaws are that it creases heavily and one tube costs $40; because I tan at times, I need 2-3 shades to match my skintone. Until now.
 I've been eyeing this palette for quite some time, and the spectrum of colors first piqued my interest. It has a greenish corrector as well as 7 peach-hued shades varying from very fair porcelain shade to dark tan, so I'll be able to use this year round (yay!). I'm planning on using the dark tans for contouring. I tried a swatch of them on my hand just now and even they are pigmented as the lighter colors, so a little will go a long way.
 $80 is expensive, yes, but if you are in need of several concealers at once, or if you have very pigmented undereye areas, this is well worth the investment. I wish I had known this all before I purchased the Anastasia contouring kit (horrid) and more concealer!
 If you give this a try, you will not be disappointed.I have the #2 conceal/contour palette. As a concealer it's great. (A little too red for contouring). It's noticeably better quality than most concealers I've tried and it better be for $80! Only weird thing is it's very affected by the weather. If there's any humidity, the palette will have droplets of water on it and will be too creamy consistency. if it's dry the colors will be extremely dry verging on chalky which is harder to work with on already dry skin. Overall very happy with it though. The coverage for under eye circles is excellent since you can custom mix the colors. fun too!Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better. I guess my skin condition wasn't great when i first used it lol. I personally find it easier to blend with a sponge rather than a brush or patting it down with a finger. 
 I got palette 01, the range is quite versatile. from the light to the dark, i can pretty much fully utilise most of the colours so it wasn't a waste. Not sure if i'll repurchase though, because of the price tag haha.I really like this palette. For me, it works. A lot of cream concealer palettes I get dry out really easily. I usually have to use my Farsali oil to hydrate them so I can apply them easily. But this palette never dries! The colors work really really well for me. They blend so beautifully. The bronzer concealers are the best. It's so hard to find cream bronzers that work for your skin and blend easily. It doesn't look muddy like other cream bronzers. The only thing that bothers me is that I wish they had larger quantities of the concealer for the price. They are rather small. But for the variety you get, I guess it's okay. I've bought it twice, and once I run out I will probably do so again.This is confusing and I may even go as far as to say- a scam!.. I am fair/light and I purchased both 1&2 palettes. I can use half the shades on both palettes to correct imperfections and color correct. I don't know why they don't just make a fair/light palette and a separate medium/dark palette. There is no way one person can use all of the shades on one of these palettes. Maybe the idea is for professional makeup artists to use in their kit on multiple people but even so, separate palettes divided into skintones would be much more useful. Will be returning.I liked this palette for about two months. Then I noticed it getting harder and harder (dry) for product to come off of palette and unto my brush. There is literally a hard film or something on top of most of these squares now. It also smells like old rancid make up now. I am a make up artist and had a client say, "EW, what smells?!". Obviously, I will not be able to use it anymore. Not cool.I bought this a while back after talking myself out of it over and over. 80 bucks is a lot of money, even for someone as big of a beauty product addict as me. It is worth it though, even though some of the colors are far too warm toned to be used for contouring, I still use them on lazy days as a quick eye color. You can cover dark under eye circles, angry hormonal zits and their fading dark reminders with just a smidge of this densely pigmented cream. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, due to the warmth of the bottom tones.This pallet offers good coverage and the green corrector shade is amazing. I wish there were more midrange neutral shades.This is a lovely palette however, I don't recommend buying this if you're only looking for a concealer or for occasional use. It also didn't do the best job hiding some of my dark spots on my face and work off quickly. I would've given it a higher rating, but for the price and rave reviews I expected it to be a bit better. I have the elf concealer palette and it covers the same amount for a fraction of the price.I own the 01 Viseart palette and I have to say it is one of the best invest, in makeup, I have made. I use this mainly for my really dark circles and it works wonders. It does not crease and it feels light wieght. I only had to use a little bit since it has very good pigmentation. This palette is also good for correcting, highlighting, and contouring. I love it. It is worth the price.I'm sure that this product is great for anyone who will be working on many different skin types but I can only use about half of the colors on myself. The bottom row is much warmer than in the pictures and shows up pretty orange. But goes on well and can cover my under eyes perfectly.I was hoping to fall in love with this product, but I didn't. This kit is extremely pigmented, which I absolutely adore; however, the darker colors are all too warm for my skin tone. They blend out orange. I only use the light yellow shade to correct my skintone under my foundation. Individuals with warmer skintones might be able to utilize this product a lot more than I have. I wish it was worth the money for me. :(I love the consistency and the thicknessI bought this online with my 20% off. I read the reviews and was so excited to have something that I could use for a concealer and a contour. I am blond hair, blue, eyed, with pale skin, I am 38 years old with very few wrinkles around my eyes. The dark circles around my eyes were my #1 concern, I played with this for hours and while I could get it to correct the circles, it just felt heavy and cakey. My #2 concern was contouring, again, the colors were fine but it just felt to heavy on my skin. I see this as being something better suited for a makeup artist but for an everyday go to product, it's not worth the price.I absolutely LOVE this concealer palette. They are so intensely pigmented. One touch of my finger or brush is all it takes to cover dark circles, redness, scars, you name it! The formula is very creamy as well, and blends like a dream.
 My only criticism is that the contour shades (bottom row) are WAY too warm to contour with. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
 However, i found a way to make it work.. Contour before foundation and do NOT blend. Then use beauty blender to pat on foundation to get a flawless, not-orange contour.
 Overall, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this item.I purchased Palette 2 earlier this year when it was the only palette available; I was sort of impressed with it and made it work, but found myself only using about 5 of the shades on a regular basis. When I saw Palette 1 was available, I ordered it immediately! Although I have only had this for a short time, I can say I have used it EVERY DAY; it really works PERFECTLY for concealing and color correcting; I purchased this explicitly because I have dark circles and under eye bags due to chronic illness and medications; I can really cover these problems up very well with this palette. The texture is really perfect; it is a very smooth, thin cream that can be covered with foundation and concealer after it dries for about 20 minutes. I have not found an equally high quality color correction/concealer palette or even single product - and believe me, I have TONS of them. It is quite expensive at $80, but I do not regret the purchase whatsoever. Also a TINY bit of this product goes a very long way; these are not thick cream consistency, but they are highly pigmented. This is one of my top 10 MUST-HAVE makeup items hands down.Was really excited to try this based on the good reviews. For the price, I thought this was going to be amazing. My intention when buying this was to correct, conceal, and contour (what this product is meant for). It did not correct my redness. The consistency was odd. It was between oily and grainy. Didn't blend as well as expected. I tried using my fingers, a brush, a damp beauty blender. It just wasn't working for me. I attempted to mix the shades on the back of my hand but the concealer just sunk right in and didn't give me a chance to mix it. Maybe mixing it on a plastic surface would have worked. Either way, I wanted this to be a one stop shop to cover all my makeup needs: conceal, correct, contour, and not be difficult to fuss with. The contour shades weren't bad. The concealers were okay. Correctors didn't work with my kind of redness. For $80, it wasn't mind blowing. Wish I loved it as much as other users.I have been eyeing this palette for a while, and with the VIB rouge sale recently I knew I had to buy it. Based on all the good reviews I really was expecting something AMAZING. This was not the case. I do have dry skin, but I heavily moisturize in the morning and use a hydrating primer: these still felt dry on my skin. I noticed through the day they almost just cracked in some places? That sounds weird but I had to keep trying to blend them out through the day and I absolutely never have this issue with makeup, and I wear makeup daily. They also felt dry in the pan, it's not like they just felt dry on the skin. I think if you have oily skin these might work well for you, but with dry skin I was SERIOUSLY unimpressed. It's also important to note that the colors are much more orange in person than they appear in that picture (I got 01 palette).
 I think the top row were definitely the creamiest, and the bronzer/contour shades I almost felt were grainy? Maybe I got a bad pan but they definitely feel GRAINY.
 Be cautious when buying. I personally wouldn't recommend this.I've been a loyal fan of the NARS radiant creamy concealer for a few years now, but was looking for some color correction concealers to mix into my routine. After coveting this palette for a few months, I finally purchased it during the November 20% off promo. And it was completely worth it. The individual NARS concealers are about $30 each and, since my tone changes seasonally, I always have to buy a new shade every few months. With this palette, It'll probably be a year or two until I buy a new concealer.
 The texture is also insanely creamy and pigmented without sitting heavily in the creases under my eyes. I am so amazed, wasn't sure it'd be worth the price, but it really is. Can't recommend this enough. Best concealer formula I've found yet.
 Only downside is that it's hard to take out in a small purse for touch ups, as it requires a brush or clean hands. Will probably keep my NARS around for going out at night.I ordered the number 1 based on the few reviews here, I have medium skin color. I search on the Internet for more reviews but there is almost none, I am surprised because the quality of this product amazing. The colors are beautiful to used as a highlighter, contour, eyeshadow, or concealer. I used the salmon and yellow colors to conceal my dark circles, it works better than NARS, I used the medium browns as a transition color eyeshadow it stays all day without creasing, the dark browns are beautiful for contouring. The ligh green gets rid of the redness around my nose immediately. The colors are creamy they slide on the skin and blend beautifully making my skin look young, a plus they stay all day. This is one of the best sets I own, I definitely recommend this product. Very versatile.I love spending time researching, buying and using makeup and skin care products; I detest spending the time to write reviews. Well here I am writing a review for the Viseart Concealer Palette 01 (with the pale green in it). I had to. It is worth every cent I paid for it. I have 5 criteria when I review a product. 1. Appearance - the packaging is simple and the concealers are housed in an good quality acrylic palette. The concealers looked fresh and inviting to use. (+1*) 2. Smell - there is no discernible odor with these cream concealers (+1*). 3. Accuracy of Product Claim - every little bit of these concealers matter because with a few tiny dabs and a 35 year old dark scar seemingly disappeared. Shades are easily blendable. Product blends easily. Coverage is the best I have ever experienced. No cake face with this stuff. (+1*). 4. Application & Removal - very easy to apply and get desired results whether it be lighter or heavier coverage. Removes easily with regular skin cleansing routine. 5. Overall value - Yes! $80 seems steep but this will last you a long while. These concealers definitely conceals, covers, camouflages, contours. I love trying new products and most that I've tried are mediocre and can easily be compared to other brands. Viseart is not an easy comparison to match. If quality and product integrity is important to you, this is a must try.I have watched this for months. Just kept eyeing it but didn't want to spend $80 on concealer . What is wrong with me!? I should have ordered day 1. It is one of the best concealers I've EVER tried. First, you get a good amount of product for the money . it goes on like butter, very smooth . It also blends seamlessly . It has a great variety of colors where you can mixThe key to finding a good shade to conceal with this is not being afraid to mix colors. I added just a tad of the red hue to the peachy pink and bam- totally covered my bluish under eye circles. I'm very pale, so the red scared me but I read up on color theory and how to cancel out certain tones and this palette is great for that if you play with it.

I love having the options of so many colors in one palette -allows for great custom blend. And really ...BARELY use any product to cover my circles, blends beautifully and doesn't crease or dry my skin. I have 1 of the eyeshadow palettes and plan on investing in all their palettes.

There is no way one person can use all of the shades on one of these palettes. Maybe the idea is for professional makeup artists to use in their kit on multiple people but even so, separate palettes divided into skintones would be much more useful. Will be returning.I liked this palette for about two months. Then I noticed it getting harder and harder (dry) for product to come off of palette and unto my brush. There is literally a hard film or something on top of most of these squares now. It also smells like old rancid make up now. I am a make up artist and had a client say, "EW, what smells?!". Obviously, I will not be able to use it anymore. Not cool.I bought this a while back after talking myself out of it over and over. 80 bucks is a lot of money, even for someone as big of a beauty product addict as me. It is worth it though, even though some of the colors are far too warm toned to be used for contouring, I still use them on lazy days as a quick eye color. You can cover dark under eye circles, angry hormonal zits and their fading dark reminders with just a smidge of this densely pigmented cream. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, due to the warmth of the bottom tones.This pallet offers good coverage and the green corrector shade is amazing. I wish there were more midrange neutral shades.This is a lovely palette however, I don't recommend buying this if you're only looking for a concealer or for occasional use. It also didn't do the best job hiding some of my dark spots on my face and work off quickly. I would've given it a higher rating, but for the price and rave reviews I expected it to be a bit better. I have the elf concealer palette and it covers the same amount for a fraction of the price.I own the 01 Viseart palette and I have to say it is one of the best invest, in makeup, I have made. I use this mainly for my really dark circles and it works wonders. It does not crease and it feels light wieght. I only had to use a little bit since it has very good pigmentation. This palette is also good for correcting, highlighting, and contouring. I love it. It is worth the price.I'm sure that this product is great for anyone who will be working on many different skin types but I can only use about half of the colors on myself. The bottom row is much warmer than in the pictures and shows up pretty orange. But goes on well and can cover my under eyes perfectly.I was hoping to fall in love with this product, but I didn't. This kit is extremely pigmented, which I absolutely adore; however, the darker colors are all too warm for my skin tone. They blend out orange. I only use the light yellow shade to correct my skintone under my foundation. Individuals with warmer skintones might be able to utilize this product a lot more than I have. I wish it was worth the money for me. :(I love the consistency and the thicknessI bought this online with my 20% off. I read the reviews and was so excited to have something that I could use for a concealer and a contour. I am blond hair, blue, eyed, with pale skin, I am 38 years old with very few wrinkles around my eyes. The dark circles around my eyes were my #1 concern, I played with this for hours and while I could get it to correct the circles, it just felt heavy and cakey. My #2 concern was contouring, again, the colors were fine but it just felt to heavy on my skin. I see this as being something better suited for a makeup artist but for an everyday go to product, it's not worth the price.I absolutely LOVE this concealer palette. They are so intensely pigmented. One touch of my finger or brush is all it takes to cover dark circles, redness, scars, you name it! The formula is very creamy as well, and blends like a dream.
 My only criticism is that the contour shades (bottom row) are WAY too warm to contour with. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
 However, i found a way to make it work.. Contour before foundation and do NOT blend. Then use beauty blender to pat on foundation to get a flawless, not-orange contour.
 Overall, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this item.I purchased Palette 2 earlier this year when it was the only palette available; I was sort of impressed with it and made it work, but found myself only using about 5 of the shades on a regular basis. When I saw Palette 1 was available, I ordered it immediately! Although I have only had this for a short time, I can say I have used it EVERY DAY; it really works PERFECTLY for concealing and color correcting; I purchased this explicitly because I have dark circles and under eye bags due to chronic illness and medications; I can really cover these problems up very well with this palette. The texture is really perfect; it is a very smooth, thin cream that can be covered with foundation and concealer after it dries for about 20 minutes. I have not found an equally high quality color correction/concealer palette or even single product - and believe me, I have TONS of them. It is quite expensive at $80, but I do not regret the purchase whatsoever. Also a TINY bit of this product goes a very long way; these are not thick cream consistency, but they are highly pigmented. This is one of my top 10 MUST-HAVE makeup items hands down.Was really excited to try this based on the good reviews. For the price, I thought this was going to be amazing. My intention when buying this was to correct, conceal, and contour (what this product is meant for). It did not correct my redness. The consistency was odd. It was between oily and grainy. Didn't blend as well as expected. I tried using my fingers, a brush, a damp beauty blender. It just wasn't working for me. I attempted to mix the shades on the back of my hand but the concealer just sunk right in and didn't give me a chance to mix it. Maybe mixing it on a plastic surface would have worked. Either way, I wanted this to be a one stop shop to cover all my makeup needs: conceal, correct, contour, and not be difficult to fuss with. The contour shades weren't bad. The concealers were okay. Correctors didn't work with my kind of redness. For $80, it wasn't mind blowing. Wish I loved it as much as other users.I have been eyeing this palette for a while, and with the VIB rouge sale recently I knew I had to buy it. Based on all the good reviews I really was expecting something AMAZING. This was not the case. I do have dry skin, but I heavily moisturize in the morning and use a hydrating primer: these still felt dry on my skin. I noticed through the day they almost just cracked in some places? That sounds weird but I had to keep trying to blend them out through the day and I absolutely never have this issue with makeup, and I wear makeup daily. They also felt dry in the pan, it's not like they just felt dry on the skin. I think if you have oily skin these might work well for you, but with dry skin I was SERIOUSLY unimpressed. It's also important to note that the colors are much more orange in person than they appear in that picture (I got 01 palette).
 I think the top row were definitely the creamiest, and the bronzer/contour shades I almost felt were grainy? Maybe I got a bad pan but they definitely feel GRAINY.
 Be cautious when buying. I personally wouldn't recommend this.I've been a loyal fan of the NARS radiant creamy concealer for a few years now, but was looking for some color correction concealers to mix into my routine. After coveting this palette for a few months, I finally purchased it during the November 20% off promo. And it was completely worth it. The individual NARS concealers are about $30 each and, since my tone changes seasonally, I always have to buy a new shade every few months. With this palette, It'll probably be a year or two until I buy a new concealer.
 The texture is also insanely creamy and pigmented without sitting heavily in the creases under my eyes. I am so amazed, wasn't sure it'd be worth the price, but it really is. Can't recommend this enough. Best concealer formula I've found yet.
 Only downside is that it's hard to take out in a small purse for touch ups, as it requires a brush or clean hands. Will probably keep my NARS around for going out at night.I ordered the number 1 based on the few reviews here, I have medium skin color. I search on the Internet for more reviews but there is almost none, I am surprised because the quality of this product amazing. The colors are beautiful to used as a highlighter, contour, eyeshadow, or concealer. I used the salmon and yellow colors to conceal my dark circles, it works better than NARS, I used the medium browns as a transition color eyeshadow it stays all day without creasing, the dark browns are beautiful for contouring. The ligh green gets rid of the redness around my nose immediately. The colors are creamy they slide on the skin and blend beautifully making my skin look young, a plus they stay all day. This is one of the best sets I own, I definitely recommend this product. Very versatile.I love spending time researching, buying and using makeup and skin care products; I detest spending the time to write reviews. Well here I am writing a review for the Viseart Concealer Palette 01 (with the pale green in it). I had to. It is worth every cent I paid for it. I have 5 criteria when I review a product. 1. Appearance - the packaging is simple and the concealers are housed in an good quality acrylic palette. The concealers looked fresh and inviting to use. (+1*) 2. Smell - there is no discernible odor with these cream concealers (+1*). 3. Accuracy of Product Claim - every little bit of these concealers matter because with a few tiny dabs and a 35 year old dark scar seemingly disappeared. Shades are easily blendable. Product blends easily. Coverage is the best I have ever experienced. No cake face with this stuff. (+1*). 4. Application & Removal - very easy to apply and get desired results whether it be lighter or heavier coverage. Removes easily with regular skin cleansing routine. 5. Overall value - Yes! $80 seems steep but this will last you a long while. These concealers definitely conceals, covers, camouflages, contours. I love trying new products and most that I've tried are mediocre and can easily be compared to other brands. Viseart is not an easy comparison to match. If quality and product integrity is important to you, this is a must try.I have watched this for months. Just kept eyeing it but didn't want to spend $80 on concealer . What is wrong with me!? I should have ordered day 1. It is one of the best concealers I've EVER tried. First, you get a good amount of product for the money . it goes on like butter, very smooth . It also blends seamlessly . It has a great variety of colors where you can mixThe key to finding a good shade to conceal with this is not being afraid to mix colors. I added just a tad of the red hue to the peachy pink and bam- totally covered my bluish under eye circles. I'm very pale, so the red scared me but I read up on color theory and how to cancel out certain tones and this palette is great for that if you play with it. I think I will get some versatility from this.I have purple pigmentation under my eyes (thanks Mom) and 95% of concealers won't cut it for me. Not Dior, not MUFE, not Kat Von D. I have been using Amazing Cosmetics' concealer for several years and it has been doing a decent job. However, the flaws are that it creases heavily and one tube costs $40; because I tan at times, I need 2-3 shades to match my skintone. Until now.
 I've been eyeing this palette for quite some time, and the spectrum of colors first piqued my interest. It has a greenish corrector as well as 7 peach-hued shades varying from very fair porcelain shade to dark tan, so I'll be able to use this year round (yay!). I'm planning on using the dark tans for contouring. I tried a swatch of them on my hand just now and even they are pigmented as the lighter colors, so a little will go a long way.
 $80 is expensive, yes, but if you are in need of several concealers at once, or if you have very pigmented undereye areas, this is well worth the investment. I wish I had known this all before I purchased the Anastasia contouring kit (horrid) and more concealer!
 If you give this a try, you will not be disappointed.I have the #2 conceal/contour palette. As a concealer it's great. (A little too red for contouring). It's noticeably better quality than most concealers I've tried and it better be for $80! Only weird thing is it's very affected by the weather. If there's any humidity, the palette will have droplets of water on it and will be too creamy consistency. if it's dry the colors will be extremely dry verging on chalky which is harder to work with on already dry skin. Overall very happy with it though. The coverage for under eye circles is excellent since you can custom mix the colors. fun too!Love the colors. Great tones and consistency. Doesn't cake up and greatCoverage. I'm very very fair skin, I use the red tones for my dark circles and the light colors to highlight and conceal. There's no reason this palette has less than 5 stars; unless you pick the wrong palette for your skin tone/color :)I have olive tones in my complexion, chronic dark circles, and work 12 hour shifts. For 10 years I've looked for a concealer that actually conceals without looking caked on and one that lasts all day. I love having the options of so many colors in one palette -allows for great custom blend. And really ...BARELY use any product to cover my circles, blends beautifully and doesn't crease or dry my skin. I have 1 of the eyeshadow palettes and plan on investing in all their palettes. The quality isI thought the MUF camouflage palette # 5 was really good, but in comparison, this palette is better both in quality and price point. It's very creamy, emollient and I need just a touch (and I mean a light touch) for coverage. I need it to tone down redness (neutralize) and highlight. This does a beautiful job without streakiness or tugging. My skin tone ranges from a light beige to medium beige ( MUF face & body makeup # 32 or # 34); the colours in this palette is perfect.I love how blendable this concealer is as I can gently layer on colour or shade over shade. I've noticed larger pores are developing in certain areas around my nose and cheek area (it's age related) and the concealers help to cover up and make my skin look smoother.I've researched this prior to purchasing and there were comments on blogs and videos about the packaging being a bit on the cheap side. I must have the new packaging as the plastic cover and case looks and feels sturdy and substantial. It's quite compact ( just a little larger than the palm of my hand) and very portable, Ease of use, blendable, good coverage, the right colour range, sturdy packaging, portable and good value for my money, speaks of a quality product in my view.Hmm... Frankly, I didn't really like it at the beginning. It was surprisingly small for the price tag and i didn't really like the way it sits on my face. But! after several uses, i came to like it muchhhh better. I guess my skin condition wasn't great when i first used it lol. I personally find it easier to blend with a sponge rather than a brush or patting it down with a finger. 
 I got palette 01, the range is quite versatile. from the light to the dark, i can pretty much fully utilise most of the colours so it wasn't a waste. Not sure if i'll repurchase though, because of the price tag haha.I really like this palette. For me, it works. A lot of cream concealer palettes I get dry out really easily. I usually have to use my Farsali oil to hydrate them so I can apply them easily. But this palette never dries! The colors work really really well for me. They blend so beautifully. The bronzer concealers are the best. It's so hard to find cream bronzers that work for your skin and blend easily. It doesn't look muddy like other cream bronzers. The only thing that bothers me is that I wish they had larger quantities of the concealer for the price. They are rather small. But for the variety you get, I guess it's okay. I've bought it twice, and once I run out I will probably do so again.This is confusing and I may even go as far as to say- a scam!.. I am fair/light and I purchased both 1&2 palettes.

There is no way one person can use all of the shades on one of these palettes. Maybe the idea is for professional makeup artists to use in their kit on multiple people but even so, separate palettes divided into skintones would be much more useful. Will be returning.I liked this palette for about two months. Then I noticed it getting harder and harder (dry) for product to come off of palette and unto my brush. There is literally a hard film or something on top of most of these squares now. It also smells like old rancid make up now. I am a make up artist and had a client say, "EW, what smells?!". Obviously, I will not be able to use it anymore. Not cool.I bought this a while back after talking myself out of it over and over. 80 bucks is a lot of money, even for someone as big of a beauty product addict as me. It is worth it though, even though some of the colors are far too warm toned to be used for contouring, I still use them on lazy days as a quick eye color. You can cover dark under eye circles, angry hormonal zits and their fading dark reminders with just a smidge of this densely pigmented cream. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, due to the warmth of the bottom tones.This pallet offers good coverage and the green corrector shade is amazing. I wish there were more midrange neutral shades.This is a lovely palette however, I don't recommend buying this if you're only looking for a concealer or for occasional use. It also didn't do the best job hiding some of my dark spots on my face and work off quickly. I would've given it a higher rating, but for the price and rave reviews I expected it to be a bit better. I have the elf concealer palette and it covers the same amount for a fraction of the price.I own the 01 Viseart palette and I have to say it is one of the best invest, in makeup, I have made. I use this mainly for my really dark circles and it works wonders. It does not crease and it feels light wieght. I only had to use a little bit since it has very good pigmentation. This palette is also good for correcting, highlighting, and contouring. I love it. It is worth the price.I'm sure that this product is great for anyone who will be working on many different skin types but I can only use about half of the colors on myself. The bottom row is much warmer than in the pictures and shows up pretty orange. But goes on well and can cover my under eyes perfectly.I was hoping to fall in love with this product, but I didn't. This kit is extremely pigmented, which I absolutely adore; however, the darker colors are all too warm for my skin tone. They blend out orange. I only use the light yellow shade to correct my skintone under my foundation. Individuals with warmer skintones might be able to utilize this product a lot more than I have. I wish it was worth the money for me. :(I love the consistency and the thicknessI bought this online with my 20% off. I read the reviews and was so excited to have something that I could use for a concealer and a contour. I am blond hair, blue, eyed, with pale skin, I am 38 years old with very few wrinkles around my eyes. The dark circles around my eyes were my #1 concern, I played with this for hours and while I could get it to correct the circles, it just felt heavy and cakey. My #2 concern was contouring, again, the colors were fine but it just felt to heavy on my skin. I see this as being something better suited for a makeup artist but for an everyday go to product, it's not worth the price.I absolutely LOVE this concealer palette. They are so intensely pigmented. One touch of my finger or brush is all it takes to cover dark circles, redness, scars, you name it! The formula is very creamy as well, and blends like a dream.
 My only criticism is that the contour shades (bottom row) are WAY too warm to contour with. This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
 However, i found a way to make it work.. Contour before foundation and do NOT blend. Then use beauty blender to pat on foundation to get a flawless, not-orange contour.
 Overall, I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this item.I purchased Palette 2 earlier this year when it was the only palette available; I was sort of impressed with it and made it work, but found myself only using about 5 of the shades on a regular basis. When I saw Palette 1 was available, I ordered it immediately! Although I have only had this for a short time, I can say I have used it EVERY DAY; it really works PERFECTLY for concealing and color correcting; I purchased this explicitly because I have dark circles and under eye bags due to chronic illness and medications; I can really cover these problems up very well with this palette. The texture is really perfect; it is a very smooth, thin cream that can be covered with foundation and concealer after it dries for about 20 minutes. I have not found an equally high quality color correction/concealer palette or even single product - and believe me, I have TONS of them. It is quite expensive at $80, but I do not regret the purchase whatsoever. Also a TINY bit of this product goes a very long way; these are not thick cream consistency, but they are highly pigmented. This is one of my top 10 MUST-HAVE makeup items hands down.Was really excited to try this based on the good reviews. For the price, I thought this was going to be amazing. My intention when buying this was to correct, conceal, and contour (what this product is meant for). It did not correct my redness. The consistency was odd. It was between oily and grainy. Didn't blend as well as expected. I tried using my fingers, a brush, a damp beauty blender. It just wasn't working for me. I attempted to mix the shades on the back of my hand but the concealer just sunk right in and didn't give me a chance to mix it. Maybe mixing it on a plastic surface would have worked. Either way, I wanted this to be a one stop shop to cover all my makeup needs: conceal, correct, contour, and not be difficult to fuss with. The contour shades weren't bad. The concealers were okay. Correctors didn't work with my kind of redness. For $80, it wasn't mind blowing. Wish I loved it as much as other users.I have been eyeing this palette for a while, and with the VIB rouge sale recently I knew I had to buy it. Based on all the good reviews I really was expecting something AMAZING. This was not the case. I do have dry skin, but I heavily moisturize in the morning and use a hydrating primer: these still felt dry on my skin. I noticed through the day they almost just cracked in some places? That sounds weird but I had to keep trying to blend them out through the day and I absolutely never have this issue with makeup, and I wear makeup daily. They also felt dry in the pan, it's not like they just felt dry on the skin. I think if you have oily skin these might work well for you, but with dry skin I was SERIOUSLY unimpressed. It's also important to note that the colors are much more orange in person than they appear in that picture (I got 01 palette).
 I think the top row were definitely the creamiest, and the bronzer/contour shades I almost felt were grainy? Maybe I got a bad pan but they definitely feel GRAINY.
 Be cautious when buying. I personally wouldn't recommend this.I've been a loyal fan of the NARS radiant creamy concealer for a few years now, but was looking for some color correction concealers to mix into my routine. After coveting this palette for a few months, I finally purchased it during the November 20% off promo. And it was completely worth it. The individual NARS concealers are about $30 each and, since my tone changes seasonally, I always have to buy a new shade every few months. With this palette, It'll probably be a year or two until I buy a new concealer.
 The texture is also insanely creamy and pigmented without sitting heavily in the creases under my eyes. I am so amazed, wasn't sure it'd be worth the price, but it really is. Can't recommend this enough. Best concealer formula I've found yet.
 Only downside is that it's hard to take out in a small purse for touch ups, as it requires a brush or clean hands. Will probably keep my NARS around for going out at night.I ordered the number 1 based on the few reviews here, I have medium skin color. I search on the Internet for more reviews but there is almost none, I am surprised because the quality of this product amazing. The colors are beautiful to used as a highlighter, contour, eyeshadow, or concealer. I used the salmon and yellow colors to conceal my dark circles, it works better than NARS, I used the medium browns as a transition color eyeshadow it stays all day without creasing, the dark browns are beautiful for contouring. The ligh green gets rid of the redness around my nose immediately. The colors are creamy they slide on the skin and blend beautifully making my skin look young, a plus they stay all day. This is one of the best sets I own, I definitely recommend this product. Very versatile.I love spending time researching, buying and using makeup and skin care products; I detest spending the time to write reviews. Well here I am writing a review for the Viseart Concealer Palette 01 (with the pale green in it). I had to. It is worth every cent I paid for it. I have 5 criteria when I review a product. 1. Appearance - the packaging is simple and the concealers are housed in an good quality acrylic palette. The concealers looked fresh and inviting to use. (+1*) 2. Smell - there is no discernible odor with these cream concealers (+1*). 3. Accuracy of Product Claim - every little bit of these concealers matter because with a few tiny dabs and a 35 year old dark scar seemingly disappeared. Shades are easily blendable. Product blends easily. Coverage is the best I have ever experienced. No cake face with this stuff. (+1*). 4. Application & Removal - very easy to apply and get desired results whether it be lighter or heavier coverage. Removes easily with regular skin cleansing routine. 5. Overall value - Yes! $80 seems steep but this will last you a long while. These concealers definitely conceals, covers, camouflages, contours. I love trying new products and most that I've tried are mediocre and can easily be compared to other brands. Viseart is not an easy comparison to match. If quality and product integrity is important to you, this is a must try.I have watched this for months. Just kept eyeing it but didn't want to spend $80 on concealer . What is wrong with me!? I should have ordered day 1. It is one of the best concealers I've EVER tried. First, you get a good amount of product for the money . it goes on like butter, very smooth . It also blends seamlessly . It has a great variety of colors where you can mixThe key to finding a good shade to conceal with this is not being afraid to mix colors. I added just a tad of the red hue to the peachy pink and bam- totally covered my bluish under eye circles. I'm very pale, so the red scared me but I read up on color theory and how to cancel out certain tones and this palette is great for that if you play with it. I think I will get some versatility from this.I have purple pigmentation under my eyes (thanks Mom) and 95% of concealers won't cut it for me. Not Dior, not MUFE, not Kat Von D. I have been using Amazing Cosmetics' concealer for several years and it has been doing a decent job. However, the flaws are that it creases heavily and one tube costs $40; because I tan at times, I need 2-3 shades to match my skintone. Until now.
 I've been eyeing this palette for quite some time, and the spectrum of colors first piqued my interest. It has a greenish corrector as well as 7 peach-hued shades varying from very fair porcelain shade to dark tan, so I'll be able to use this year round (yay!). I'm planning on using the dark tans for contouring. I tried a swatch of them on my hand just now and even they are pigmented as the lighter colors, so a little will go a long way.
 $80 is expensive, yes, but if you are in need of several concealers at once, or if you have very pigmented undereye areas, this is well worth the investment. I wish I had known this all before I purchased the Anastasia contouring kit (horrid) and more concealer!
 If you give this a try, you will not be disappointed.I have the #2 conceal/contour palette. As a concealer it's great. (A little too red for contouring). It's noticeably better quality than most concealers I've tried and it better be for $80! Only weird thing is it's very affected by the weather. If there's any humidity, the palette will have droplets of water on it and will be too creamy consistency. if it's dry the colors will be extremely dry verging on chalky which is harder to work with on already dry skin. Overall very happy with it though. The coverage for under eye circles is excellent since you can custom mix the colors. fun too!Love the colors. Great tones and consistency. Doesn't cake up and greatCoverage. I'm very very fair skin, I use the red tones for my dark circles and the light colors to highlight and conceal. There's no reason this palette has less than 5 stars; unless you pick the wrong palette for your skin tone/color :)I have olive tones in my complexion, chronic dark circles, and work 12 hour shifts. For 10 years I've looked for a concealer that actually conceals without looking caked on and one that lasts all day. I love having the options of so many colors in one palette -allows for great custom blend. And really ...BARELY use any product to cover my circles, blends beautifully and doesn't crease or dry my skin. I have 1 of the eyeshadow palettes and plan on investing in all their palettes. The quality isI thought the MUF camouflage palette # 5 was really good, but in comparison, this palette is better both in quality and price point. It's very creamy, emollient and I need just a touch (and I mean a light touch) for coverage. I need it to tone down redness (neutralize) and highlight. This does a beautiful job without streakiness or tugging. My skin tone ranges from a light beige to medium beige ( MUF face & body makeup # 32 or # 34); the colours in this palette is perfect.I love how blendable this concealer is as I can gently layer on colour or shade over shade. I've noticed larger pores are developing in certain areas around my nose and cheek area (it's age related) and the concealers help to cover up and make my skin look smoother.I've researched this prior to purchasing and there were comments on blogs and videos about the packaging being a bit on the cheap side. I must have the new packaging as the plastic cover and case looks and feels sturdy and substantial. It's quite compact ( just a little larger than the palm of my hand) and very portable, Ease of use, blendable, good coverage, the right colour range, sturdy packaging, portable and good value for my money, speaks of a quality product in my view.This palette is absolutely wonderful. It's creamy, blendable, and most of all DOES NOT CREASE!!! It's very expensive but having such a rainbow of colors in one palette, you can't go wrong honestly. I got the 01 palette. I have a bit of redness on my cheeks and the green works so well at correcting it. I really love this palette. Def worth every penny. NO CREASING HERE!!If you are looking to just use this palette to correct and conceal, then this product is definitely for you. This palette is creamy, easy to work with, and blends seamlessly. The packaging is compact and durable. The only thing I did not like is that the contour colors in this palette run on the warm side and have reddish tones (more like a bronzer). I personally like a grey-toned or neutral-toned brown to contour with.
