This is the absolute best bronzer for my complexion I have ever, ever, ever, ever used..... and I have tried at least 20 different brands/colors!!! And I'm not talking cheap brands I mean expensive brands! And this one running circles around most of them!! I still have a couple others that I like..... but this one I love love love!!!!! Especially when you compare cost of the other two that I like!!!! If you like this make up brand you will love this bronzer! If you're new to this brand...you have to give it a shot!! I know you will be happily surprised!!!!! I would recommend this for our young girls just starting to learn how to use make up because it's a buildable color and blends like a dream but I would also recommend it to a make up junkie like me because of the quality. It's so creamy, blends like a dream and an ACTUALLY SEEN IN NATURE COLOR!!!! Can any of you relate to thinking your bronzer was beautiful and seeing a picture of yourself in the sun and realizing you look like a Cheeto? Uggggg!!!! I HAVE with a $60 bronzer. I tried to give it away and NO ONE wanted it..... so take advice from someone who is dabbled in a lot of bronzers this one is great!!!! ❤️This is the absolute best bronzer for my complexion I have ever, ever, ever, ever used..... and I have tried at least 20 different brands/colors!!!
