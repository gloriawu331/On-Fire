The smell of this product is incredible. It smells like grass and roses, just like the Tata Harper Love Potion perfume. However, it has not been effective at reducing any of stretch marks, and it's really greasy and takes time to rub in. I never want to use it because it's like being coated in Crisco.Wanted to like it but have to agree with another reviewer: it's just high-priced, rose-fragranced Shea butter and I expect a whole, whole lot more for the price.It's pretty hard to use as it is really hard and thick. I can tell it is high quality, but it doesn't seem to do much for any part of my body. Smells nice though.Body redefining? How about simply thick and Shea butter heavy moisturizer. I love her face products but it gave no extra definition to my relatively toned body, false advertising to put it nicely.Yes It Is :A highly-effective body balm if i can write about the product 10 stars i will add . It provides deep moisture,i was surprise by the good size of it keep it on like that , Thank you Sahfora and Tatafor bring it to the store i am going to perches the body oil pleas bring the aruma night tooDon't let yourself try this, because then you'll be out $110 every time you need body moisturizer (and not sure container will last me that long!). I got to meet a Tata rep at a Neiman's event and she made me try this. I wasn't completely sold but finally purchased and it's seriously A M A Z I N G. It's perfect for my December dry skin right now. I put it on at night and wake up with incredibly soft skin. Not sure if it truly helps stretch marks, we shall see. I love this entire line, and this product may well be my #1.The smell of this product is incredible. It smells like grass and roses, just like the Tata Harper Love Potion perfume.
