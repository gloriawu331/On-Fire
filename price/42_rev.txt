This is a great buy if you wanna try out lancers products. I'm completely addicted to the whole line. It really does wonders for your skin! The scents are fresh and light. I have combination skin. After using the products religiously for 3 monthsI have fewer blackheads and smaller pores, almost no breakouts and my skin feels smooth and my complexion has improved.These products are amazing. My pores have never been this small. I've also struggled for years with back and chest acne and that has completely disappeared. This stuff is the real deal.I am about a week into using the lancer method. It is fantastic! I have sensitive skin. Not overly but i can get reactions from skincare lines. This works great! Go gentle on the scrub. Very light pressure. Then the cleanser and nourish are so soothing! My skin is glowing and smooth. Looking forward to purchasing the full size.I've been using the Lancer method for almost a year now and my complexion is significantly better that its ever been. My skin tone has improved, I don't have any fine lines and my skin is so soft.
 My face broke out when I first used the Dr. Lancers products but I think I scrubbed too hard with the polish and my face needed time to adjust to the products. I'm glad I stuck with it!
 The body products are fantastic! All the marks on my skin are gone, my legs are super smooth and more radiant.
 I have the full size of all of the products but I love the convenience of having these mini sizes when I travel. Hope Sephora will carry the rest of the Lance product line soon.I purchased this product because I am in my 20s still suffering from acne and it had such great reviews. I was so excited to use this product but I had a terrible experience with this and it is not worth the money at all. I used the products until finish, hopefully that it may took time to be effective, NO. I made my acne worse, I broke out even more along my jaw line. The scrub (polish) and face wash (cleanse) did not make me feel clean at all, it just tugged and irritated my skin. Please try this before you buy it.This was such a great way to try all the products he has to offer. The Method for the face and body. Amazing products. Felt a difference in my skin after ONE use! Could make a great gift too :)This is a great buy if you wanna try out lancers products. I'm completely addicted to the whole line. It really does wonders for your skin!
