I work for L'occitane so I tried this out as soon as it launched and I'm pretty impressed with it. I like this Shea skincare product more than the previous cleansers from the line because it works better for my combination skin as it doesn't leave a residue. It cleanses really nicely and is a great option if you have sensitive skin but still want a nice bubbly lather, just don't get it in your eyes!I work for L'occitane so I tried this out as soon as it launched and I'm pretty impressed with it.
