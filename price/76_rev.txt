Me gusta la variedad de tonos que incluyeron en esta palette de Iluminadores, el que sean en crema, hace que el acabado en tu piel sea mas "natural" a mi punto de vista, lo único que no me gusto fue el iluminador en tono gris(plateado) los demás están perfectos.Yo recibí este producto por parte de la pagina Influenster, pero mi opinion es honesta y sincera. #gotitfree #review #honestreviewI received this free from influenster to test out and i love it! i was actually really surprised at how much i liked it because i never use cream highlighters. But these are just so lightweight and bendable they dont feel heavy on the skin at all. The pigmentation is great, and i love the different shades. Aurora is definitely my favorite i to boost my radiant glow under foundation. The only downside is the fact that it does not sit on foundation well. It looks amazing underneath but on top it separates the foundation. If you gently dab it on the high points of your cheeks to highlight it doesn't separate just as long as you avoid using a blending motion. It also makes for a great base to a powder highlight for the ultimate glow.So I was sent this product for free by Influenster to review it. The packaging is stunning. The mirror inside is large and perfect for travel. It has a magnetic closure so it is good for traveling. The products insides are okay. They are cream highlights or eyeshadows. The pink, gold, and taupe shade are glory without shimmer or very little. The white shade has tiny blue glitters and the silver shade has chunky glitter, but it's not textured. Over all, if you build it up it's very beautiful and natural lookingFirst off, the packaging is gorgeous. I love the pinky blush shade in the palette. It is a warm pink with a gold reflect, it reminds me a lot of Nars orgasm. Now the gold and bronze highlights, while they are gorgeous and not chunky, they're too dark for my porcelain fair skin as highlights. However I've tried the bronze shade as like a glowy no makeup bronzer look and I enjoyed it! The biggest let down of this palette for me was that the two lighter shades are pretty unflattering. One is a chunky silver, and the other a chunky iridescent blue. You can see the glitter sitting on your face. The creams do blend out extremely easily with the fingers and once set will not move all day. So if you don't mind chunky highlights, or if you're a bit darker than me, this palette could become your new go to :) Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I like how it sits on top of powder but it's hard to love with the application process. I've been using my fingers and I'm not a fan of it, if they had a brush or sponge made of it would help a lot. I love the glow I get from the highlights. I just glow! Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.This product is an okay option for those looking for a creamy Highlighter. It is very VERY sheer and more on the glittery side. Now with the price taken into account, I'm not sure it is worth it... I'd recommend trying it in the store first. My more detailed review video is below.If you read the directions and do it right, it works wonderfully! I have combination skin and I love the smooth feel of it!despise the wide range of reviews I think this palette will be my go to highlighter for some time, I think it's quite easy and simple to use, especially since I've been preferring the wet version of highlighters recently. I use my beauty blender to blend and mix my own customized highlighting shade to achieve that natural dewy trendy look, and I love it. Also the packaging is just gorgeous as well, hard to keep my eyes off of it. 
 *I received this product complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.The texture of the product itself is creamy but by that being said it's really easy to build up the color whether you want a natural glow or a beaming highlight. I loved the variety of colors that the palette has! There's literally one for every skin tone! I also LOVED the packaging <3. Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes from Influenster. This Palette is a cream highlight Palette and with me having oily skin I was a little worried I wouldn't like it on my skin. I can't use it by itself but I DO however, use it as a base for my powder highlights to intensify them and I love it! Love the packaging as well.I am so happy of have received this complementary from Influenster for testing purposes, the colors are stunning and I am in love with this!I've been a fan of Laura Mercier cosmetics for years, and was super excited when I'd received this palette complimentary for review purposes. It is a cream palette so buildable coverage and definitely set it with setting powder before moving on. I've seen some bad reviews about it and let me remind any product junkie out there, Laura Mercier concept is having a flawless face by using her products to accentuate your natural beauty. These highlighting cream does just that. A very polish application when I pair it with my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and "baked" everything with her translucent powder. It will not give you the exaggerated highlighted look that is trending on social media.. it can if you build and set several layers.Received the Lightstruck prismatic glow palette complimentary for review purposes. I was surprised to find the pigmentation is sheer with these creams. It's different from most creams and liquid highlighters on the market today. The colors don't layer well with powder highlighters (I tried layering and ABH glow kit on top and it looked cakey and powdery) These are definitely more for a natural look and best used by themselves with little product underneath. I think i'll be using them as body highlighters, they look really pretty when fully blended out on the collarbones.I got to swatch this palette in-store today for the highlighter launch event. I was totally let down by this palette. I mean, really, is this REALLY a Laura Mercier product??! I was shocked! Let's just say that ANY, even Drugstore highlighter, whether balm, liquid, powder (doesn't matter), but drugstore ones beat this anyday! Wow, this is a horrible product n palette! :( Save ur money, Loves. I can't see using this product (any part of it) for anything! Ugh, sorry I'm usually the one that takes the time to write reviews that r positive but I wanted to warn anyone out there about just how much of a letdown this was. Still can't believe Laura Mercier put this out. :(((Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes. I absolutely love this palette! They are very easy to blend, super pigmented , and beginner friendly. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves highlighting.I actually really liked this product more than I anticipated! I thought at first that the glitter would be too chunky, and that the cream would overall be too thick and not blendable. I was so wrong! All of these shades are sheer and contribute to an all-over "glowing from within" look. I love how sheer they are- they give you a healthy flush that way.I love this product. The different shades they provide in this pallet allow you to create a few different lookes (day and night). I found that this palette allowed my face to naturally glow. the texture of the product is what i loved most. soft, creamy, and very easy to apply.This palette was sent to me complementary by Influenster for review and testing purposes. This has beautiful packaging but I'm more likely going to use it as a display than actual makeup, because the product isn't that exciting. The glow is a little glittery and not that pigmented. I also didn't find it to be buildable at all but I suppose it would be good for a subtle glow if you're into that.When I first saw this palette I was in awe. I mean, have you seen the packaging? Any way the light catches it bounces a rainbow effect right back. Once I got inside the colors were so gorgeous, the only one I was weary about was the Beam shade. Out of all of the shades, I am capable of wearing about 3 of them personally. I would not go out of my way to purchase this highlighter kit due to it being cream and I am not a big fan of the "greasy" texture on my face personally. The two lightest shades slightly make my face look ashy after a little bit.The colors of this palette are really pretty. Neutrals are my favorite so I am taking advantage of it so much! I like that they last long and that it could also be a perfect gift.When I received this product I was so excited to use it. The colors looked beautiful and would be useful for highlighting my face differently. Only when I began using the product did I become slightly dissatisfied. The consistency is almost oily. After trying the products I did not like the way it felt on my skin, greasy almost. The colors are still beautiful though, so I have to give a little to get a little!! I Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I am fairly new to highlighting my face. Originally, I was a big fan of bronzer and I used the sheen or glitter in the bronzer as a "highlighter" (lame, I know). But since getting this product, I finally realize the power and beauty of highlighting! It actually makes your face look more natural and vibrant as it draws the light towards you and makes you look radiant. The palette comes with five colors, so you can mix and match and are not consistently stuck with the same highlighter. That is my favorite thing about this product - there are more subtle colors (like ray and prism) that I can use in the daytime, but there are also darker. bolder colors that I like to use to intensify my look at night. My only issue is the lasting power, the highlight seems to fade after a few hours..maybe I need to pair it with a setting powder or primer. Overall, fantastic product and a great product to introduce people to highlighting!I just received the Laura MercierLightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette in the mail. The packaging is really pretty but the product itself is not so great! I'm not a fan of cream highlighters because I have oily skin, and this formulation feels like lipstick or cream eye shadow. Also, most of the colors made me look ashy out of 5 I can only use 2. Overall, this palette isn't worth it!I really wanted to LOVE this product. I love cream highlighters but some of these shapes are just way to glittery. I use this on my face today using ray on my cheeks since that would be more of a highlight for me but it has blue chunky glitters throughout and you could really tell on my face. I ended up putting my other Laura mercier highlight in 01 to mix in on my cheekbones and that did look a little better and hid the chunky glitter. All in all this was an okay palette but I don't think it would be worth the money. 
 **Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I loved this palette. The colors were great on my skin town and had just the right amount of shimmer. The only thing I did not love about this palette was the bronzer. The bronzer was very sheer and hard to work with.I received this from influenster free for testing purposes, and I'm so glad I did! I have been having so much fun layering the different shades to see what look I can get! I have to say aurora is my favorite because it has the least sparkle and just looks like a glow from within!

This new glow palette has a lot of options to offer. I have only worn the Aurora over my face/eyelids with Reflect layered over it. The creaminess of this makeup makes it easy to layer on, and it doesn't feel heavy on my face. 
 I wore this make up on two days back to back, and despite having breakout prone skin, did not break out - which is a HUGE plus in my book. 
 Lightstruck also made my skin look fairly clear in photos - I was really happy with how this turned out.

It is a warm pink with a gold reflect, it reminds me a lot of Nars orgasm. Now the gold and bronze highlights, while they are gorgeous and not chunky, they're too dark for my porcelain fair skin as highlights. However I've tried the bronze shade as like a glowy no makeup bronzer look and I enjoyed it! The biggest let down of this palette for me was that the two lighter shades are pretty unflattering. One is a chunky silver, and the other a chunky iridescent blue. You can see the glitter sitting on your face. The creams do blend out extremely easily with the fingers and once set will not move all day. So if you don't mind chunky highlights, or if you're a bit darker than me, this palette could become your new go to :) Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I received this from influenster free for testing purposes, and I'm so glad I did!

All of the shades in this palette are so beautiful! they can be stacked or worn alone! 2 of the shades on the right are very glittery the other three don't have glitter. This palette is great for that glow from within look. it blends very easily, the formula is super creamy! a little bit goes a long way.Me gusta la variedad de tonos que incluyeron en esta palette de Iluminadores, el que sean en crema, hace que el acabado en tu piel sea mas "natural" a mi punto de vista, lo único que no me gusto fue el iluminador en tono gris(plateado) los demás están perfectos.Yo recibí este producto por parte de la pagina Influenster, pero mi opinion es honesta y sincera. #gotitfree #review #honestreviewI received this free from influenster to test out and i love it! i was actually really surprised at how much i liked it because i never use cream highlighters. But these are just so lightweight and bendable they dont feel heavy on the skin at all. The pigmentation is great, and i love the different shades. Aurora is definitely my favorite i to boost my radiant glow under foundation. The only downside is the fact that it does not sit on foundation well. It looks amazing underneath but on top it separates the foundation. If you gently dab it on the high points of your cheeks to highlight it doesn't separate just as long as you avoid using a blending motion. It also makes for a great base to a powder highlight for the ultimate glow.So I was sent this product for free by Influenster to review it. The packaging is stunning. The mirror inside is large and perfect for travel. It has a magnetic closure so it is good for traveling. The products insides are okay. They are cream highlights or eyeshadows. The pink, gold, and taupe shade are glory without shimmer or very little. The white shade has tiny blue glitters and the silver shade has chunky glitter, but it's not textured. Over all, if you build it up it's very beautiful and natural lookingFirst off, the packaging is gorgeous. I love the pinky blush shade in the palette. It is a warm pink with a gold reflect, it reminds me a lot of Nars orgasm. Now the gold and bronze highlights, while they are gorgeous and not chunky, they're too dark for my porcelain fair skin as highlights. However I've tried the bronze shade as like a glowy no makeup bronzer look and I enjoyed it! The biggest let down of this palette for me was that the two lighter shades are pretty unflattering. One is a chunky silver, and the other a chunky iridescent blue. You can see the glitter sitting on your face. The creams do blend out extremely easily with the fingers and once set will not move all day. So if you don't mind chunky highlights, or if you're a bit darker than me, this palette could become your new go to :) Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I like how it sits on top of powder but it's hard to love with the application process. I've been using my fingers and I'm not a fan of it, if they had a brush or sponge made of it would help a lot. I love the glow I get from the highlights. I just glow! Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I received this from influenster free for testing purposes, and I'm so glad I did! I have been having so much fun layering the different shades to see what look I can get! I have to say aurora is my favorite because it has the least sparkle and just looks like a glow from within! I am a freelance makeup artist and can't wait to try this on clients of all skin tones!I am a very loyal to my products type of makeup girl, and have used Candlelight by Benefit as my highlighter for several years. This new glow palette has a lot of options to offer. I have only worn the Aurora over my face/eyelids with Reflect layered over it. The creaminess of this makeup makes it easy to layer on, and it doesn't feel heavy on my face. 
 I wore this make up on two days back to back, and despite having breakout prone skin, did not break out - which is a HUGE plus in my book. 
 Lightstruck also made my skin look fairly clear in photos - I was really happy with how this turned out. I am looking forward to another weekend out somewhere so that I can play with other looks.Honestly I haven't used cream highlighters before this one but I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, I think this palette is a little to light and sheer for my complexion but I must say Prism is definitely wearable and buildable it is the golden shade and catches the light beautifully I love it. Ray can be used as a brow bone and inner corner highlight as well.When I got this I will admit I was a little hesitant because it was a cream highlight, but i had time to play around with it and out of everything I LOVE the blush and the contour the most. The highlighters are good especially for special occasions but the blush is so beautiful on the skin and looks very dewy.

Unfortunately, I think this palette is a little to light and sheer for my complexion but I must say Prism is definitely wearable and buildable it is the golden shade and catches the light beautifully I love it. Ray can be used as a brow bone and inner corner highlight as well.When I got this I will admit I was a little hesitant because it was a cream highlight, but i had time to play around with it and out of everything I LOVE the blush and the contour the most. The highlighters are good especially for special occasions but the blush is so beautiful on the skin and looks very dewy. This pallet is functional for everyday makeup which I like and most of the colors are build-able. I received this product free for review purposesI love this product so much! first off the packaging is beautiful! it closes with a magnet and comes with a huge mirror inside. All of the shades in this palette are so beautiful! they can be stacked or worn alone! 2 of the shades on the right are very glittery the other three don't have glitter. This palette is great for that glow from within look. it blends very easily, the formula is super creamy! a little bit goes a long way.Me gusta la variedad de tonos que incluyeron en esta palette de Iluminadores, el que sean en crema, hace que el acabado en tu piel sea mas "natural" a mi punto de vista, lo único que no me gusto fue el iluminador en tono gris(plateado) los demás están perfectos.Yo recibí este producto por parte de la pagina Influenster, pero mi opinion es honesta y sincera. #gotitfree #review #honestreviewI received this free from influenster to test out and i love it! i was actually really surprised at how much i liked it because i never use cream highlighters. But these are just so lightweight and bendable they dont feel heavy on the skin at all. The pigmentation is great, and i love the different shades. Aurora is definitely my favorite i to boost my radiant glow under foundation. The only downside is the fact that it does not sit on foundation well. It looks amazing underneath but on top it separates the foundation. If you gently dab it on the high points of your cheeks to highlight it doesn't separate just as long as you avoid using a blending motion. It also makes for a great base to a powder highlight for the ultimate glow.So I was sent this product for free by Influenster to review it. The packaging is stunning. The mirror inside is large and perfect for travel. It has a magnetic closure so it is good for traveling. The products insides are okay. They are cream highlights or eyeshadows. The pink, gold, and taupe shade are glory without shimmer or very little. The white shade has tiny blue glitters and the silver shade has chunky glitter, but it's not textured. Over all, if you build it up it's very beautiful and natural lookingFirst off, the packaging is gorgeous. I love the pinky blush shade in the palette. It is a warm pink with a gold reflect, it reminds me a lot of Nars orgasm. Now the gold and bronze highlights, while they are gorgeous and not chunky, they're too dark for my porcelain fair skin as highlights. However I've tried the bronze shade as like a glowy no makeup bronzer look and I enjoyed it! The biggest let down of this palette for me was that the two lighter shades are pretty unflattering. One is a chunky silver, and the other a chunky iridescent blue. You can see the glitter sitting on your face. The creams do blend out extremely easily with the fingers and once set will not move all day. So if you don't mind chunky highlights, or if you're a bit darker than me, this palette could become your new go to :) Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I like how it sits on top of powder but it's hard to love with the application process. I've been using my fingers and I'm not a fan of it, if they had a brush or sponge made of it would help a lot. I love the glow I get from the highlights. I just glow! Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.This product is an okay option for those looking for a creamy Highlighter. It is very VERY sheer and more on the glittery side. Now with the price taken into account, I'm not sure it is worth it... I'd recommend trying it in the store first. My more detailed review video is below.If you read the directions and do it right, it works wonderfully! I have combination skin and I love the smooth feel of it!despise the wide range of reviews I think this palette will be my go to highlighter for some time, I think it's quite easy and simple to use, especially since I've been preferring the wet version of highlighters recently. I use my beauty blender to blend and mix my own customized highlighting shade to achieve that natural dewy trendy look, and I love it. Also the packaging is just gorgeous as well, hard to keep my eyes off of it. 
 *I received this product complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.The texture of the product itself is creamy but by that being said it's really easy to build up the color whether you want a natural glow or a beaming highlight. I loved the variety of colors that the palette has! There's literally one for every skin tone! I also LOVED the packaging <3. Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes from Influenster. This Palette is a cream highlight Palette and with me having oily skin I was a little worried I wouldn't like it on my skin. I can't use it by itself but I DO however, use it as a base for my powder highlights to intensify them and I love it! Love the packaging as well.I am so happy of have received this complementary from Influenster for testing purposes, the colors are stunning and I am in love with this!I received this from influenster free for testing purposes, and I'm so glad I did! I have been having so much fun layering the different shades to see what look I can get! I have to say aurora is my favorite because it has the least sparkle and just looks like a glow from within! I am a freelance makeup artist and can't wait to try this on clients of all skin tones!I am a very loyal to my products type of makeup girl, and have used Candlelight by Benefit as my highlighter for several years. This new glow palette has a lot of options to offer. I have only worn the Aurora over my face/eyelids with Reflect layered over it. The creaminess of this makeup makes it easy to layer on, and it doesn't feel heavy on my face. 
 I wore this make up on two days back to back, and despite having breakout prone skin, did not break out - which is a HUGE plus in my book.

It is a cream palette so buildable coverage and definitely set it with setting powder before moving on. I've seen some bad reviews about it and let me remind any product junkie out there, Laura Mercier concept is having a flawless face by using her products to accentuate your natural beauty. These highlighting cream does just that. A very polish application when I pair it with my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and "baked" everything with her translucent powder. It will not give you the exaggerated highlighted look that is trending on social media.. it can if you build and set several layers.I received this from influenster free for testing purposes, and I'm so glad I did!

I was totally let down by this palette. I mean, really, is this REALLY a Laura Mercier product??! I was shocked! Let's just say that ANY, even Drugstore highlighter, whether balm, liquid, powder (doesn't matter), but drugstore ones beat this anyday! Wow, this is a horrible product n palette! :( Save ur money, Loves. I can't see using this product (any part of it) for anything! Ugh, sorry I'm usually the one that takes the time to write reviews that r positive but I wanted to warn anyone out there about just how much of a letdown this was. Still can't believe Laura Mercier put this out. :(((I received this from influenster free for testing purposes, and I'm so glad I did!

One is a chunky silver, and the other a chunky iridescent blue. You can see the glitter sitting on your face. The creams do blend out extremely easily with the fingers and once set will not move all day. So if you don't mind chunky highlights, or if you're a bit darker than me, this palette could become your new go to :) Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I like how it sits on top of powder but it's hard to love with the application process.

I was surprised to find the pigmentation is sheer with these creams. It's different from most creams and liquid highlighters on the market today. The colors don't layer well with powder highlighters (I tried layering and ABH glow kit on top and it looked cakey and powdery) These are definitely more for a natural look and best used by themselves with little product underneath. I think i'll be using them as body highlighters, they look really pretty when fully blended out on the collarbones.I got to swatch this palette in-store today for the highlighter launch event. I was totally let down by this palette. I mean, really, is this REALLY a Laura Mercier product??! I was shocked!

They are very easy to blend, super pigmented , and beginner friendly. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves highlighting.I received this from influenster free for testing purposes, and I'm so glad I did! I have been having so much fun layering the different shades to see what look I can get! I have to say aurora is my favorite because it has the least sparkle and just looks like a glow from within! I am a freelance makeup artist and can't wait to try this on clients of all skin tones!I am a very loyal to my products type of makeup girl, and have used Candlelight by Benefit as my highlighter for several years. This new glow palette has a lot of options to offer. I have only worn the Aurora over my face/eyelids with Reflect layered over it. The creaminess of this makeup makes it easy to layer on, and it doesn't feel heavy on my face. 
 I wore this make up on two days back to back, and despite having breakout prone skin, did not break out - which is a HUGE plus in my book. 
 Lightstruck also made my skin look fairly clear in photos - I was really happy with how this turned out. I am looking forward to another weekend out somewhere so that I can play with other looks.Honestly I haven't used cream highlighters before this one but I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, I think this palette is a little to light and sheer for my complexion but I must say Prism is definitely wearable and buildable it is the golden shade and catches the light beautifully I love it. Ray can be used as a brow bone and inner corner highlight as well.When I got this I will admit I was a little hesitant because it was a cream highlight, but i had time to play around with it and out of everything I LOVE the blush and the contour the most. The highlighters are good especially for special occasions but the blush is so beautiful on the skin and looks very dewy. This pallet is functional for everyday makeup which I like and most of the colors are build-able. I received this product free for review purposesI love this product so much! first off the packaging is beautiful! it closes with a magnet and comes with a huge mirror inside. All of the shades in this palette are so beautiful! they can be stacked or worn alone! 2 of the shades on the right are very glittery the other three don't have glitter. This palette is great for that glow from within look. it blends very easily, the formula is super creamy! a little bit goes a long way.Me gusta la variedad de tonos que incluyeron en esta palette de Iluminadores, el que sean en crema, hace que el acabado en tu piel sea mas "natural" a mi punto de vista, lo único que no me gusto fue el iluminador en tono gris(plateado) los demás están perfectos.Yo recibí este producto por parte de la pagina Influenster, pero mi opinion es honesta y sincera. #gotitfree #review #honestreviewI received this free from influenster to test out and i love it! i was actually really surprised at how much i liked it because i never use cream highlighters. But these are just so lightweight and bendable they dont feel heavy on the skin at all. The pigmentation is great, and i love the different shades. Aurora is definitely my favorite i to boost my radiant glow under foundation. The only downside is the fact that it does not sit on foundation well. It looks amazing underneath but on top it separates the foundation. If you gently dab it on the high points of your cheeks to highlight it doesn't separate just as long as you avoid using a blending motion. It also makes for a great base to a powder highlight for the ultimate glow.So I was sent this product for free by Influenster to review it. The packaging is stunning. The mirror inside is large and perfect for travel. It has a magnetic closure so it is good for traveling. The products insides are okay. They are cream highlights or eyeshadows. The pink, gold, and taupe shade are glory without shimmer or very little. The white shade has tiny blue glitters and the silver shade has chunky glitter, but it's not textured. Over all, if you build it up it's very beautiful and natural lookingFirst off, the packaging is gorgeous. I love the pinky blush shade in the palette. It is a warm pink with a gold reflect, it reminds me a lot of Nars orgasm. Now the gold and bronze highlights, while they are gorgeous and not chunky, they're too dark for my porcelain fair skin as highlights.

 Lightstruck also made my skin look fairly clear in photos - I was really happy with how this turned out. I am looking forward to another weekend out somewhere so that I can play with other looks.Honestly I haven't used cream highlighters before this one but I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, I think this palette is a little to light and sheer for my complexion but I must say Prism is definitely wearable and buildable it is the golden shade and catches the light beautifully I love it. Ray can be used as a brow bone and inner corner highlight as well.When I got this I will admit I was a little hesitant because it was a cream highlight, but i had time to play around with it and out of everything I LOVE the blush and the contour the most. The highlighters are good especially for special occasions but the blush is so beautiful on the skin and looks very dewy. This pallet is functional for everyday makeup which I like and most of the colors are build-able. I received this product free for review purposesI love this product so much! first off the packaging is beautiful! it closes with a magnet and comes with a huge mirror inside. All of the shades in this palette are so beautiful! they can be stacked or worn alone! 2 of the shades on the right are very glittery the other three don't have glitter. This palette is great for that glow from within look. it blends very easily, the formula is super creamy! a little bit goes a long way.Me gusta la variedad de tonos que incluyeron en esta palette de Iluminadores, el que sean en crema, hace que el acabado en tu piel sea mas "natural" a mi punto de vista, lo único que no me gusto fue el iluminador en tono gris(plateado) los demás están perfectos.Yo recibí este producto por parte de la pagina Influenster, pero mi opinion es honesta y sincera. #gotitfree #review #honestreviewI received this free from influenster to test out and i love it! i was actually really surprised at how much i liked it because i never use cream highlighters. But these are just so lightweight and bendable they dont feel heavy on the skin at all. The pigmentation is great, and i love the different shades. Aurora is definitely my favorite i to boost my radiant glow under foundation. The only downside is the fact that it does not sit on foundation well. It looks amazing underneath but on top it separates the foundation. If you gently dab it on the high points of your cheeks to highlight it doesn't separate just as long as you avoid using a blending motion. It also makes for a great base to a powder highlight for the ultimate glow.So I was sent this product for free by Influenster to review it. The packaging is stunning. The mirror inside is large and perfect for travel. It has a magnetic closure so it is good for traveling. The products insides are okay. They are cream highlights or eyeshadows. The pink, gold, and taupe shade are glory without shimmer or very little. The white shade has tiny blue glitters and the silver shade has chunky glitter, but it's not textured. Over all, if you build it up it's very beautiful and natural lookingFirst off, the packaging is gorgeous. I love the pinky blush shade in the palette. It is a warm pink with a gold reflect, it reminds me a lot of Nars orgasm. Now the gold and bronze highlights, while they are gorgeous and not chunky, they're too dark for my porcelain fair skin as highlights. However I've tried the bronze shade as like a glowy no makeup bronzer look and I enjoyed it! The biggest let down of this palette for me was that the two lighter shades are pretty unflattering. One is a chunky silver, and the other a chunky iridescent blue. You can see the glitter sitting on your face. The creams do blend out extremely easily with the fingers and once set will not move all day. So if you don't mind chunky highlights, or if you're a bit darker than me, this palette could become your new go to :) Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I like how it sits on top of powder but it's hard to love with the application process. I've been using my fingers and I'm not a fan of it, if they had a brush or sponge made of it would help a lot. I love the glow I get from the highlights. I just glow! Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.This product is an okay option for those looking for a creamy Highlighter. It is very VERY sheer and more on the glittery side. Now with the price taken into account, I'm not sure it is worth it... I'd recommend trying it in the store first. My more detailed review video is below.If you read the directions and do it right, it works wonderfully! I have combination skin and I love the smooth feel of it!despise the wide range of reviews I think this palette will be my go to highlighter for some time, I think it's quite easy and simple to use, especially since I've been preferring the wet version of highlighters recently. I use my beauty blender to blend and mix my own customized highlighting shade to achieve that natural dewy trendy look, and I love it. Also the packaging is just gorgeous as well, hard to keep my eyes off of it. 
 *I received this product complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.The texture of the product itself is creamy but by that being said it's really easy to build up the color whether you want a natural glow or a beaming highlight. I loved the variety of colors that the palette has! There's literally one for every skin tone! I also LOVED the packaging <3. Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes from Influenster. This Palette is a cream highlight Palette and with me having oily skin I was a little worried I wouldn't like it on my skin. I can't use it by itself but I DO however, use it as a base for my powder highlights to intensify them and I love it! Love the packaging as well.I am so happy of have received this complementary from Influenster for testing purposes, the colors are stunning and I am in love with this!I've been a fan of Laura Mercier cosmetics for years, and was super excited when I'd received this palette complimentary for review purposes. It is a cream palette so buildable coverage and definitely set it with setting powder before moving on. I've seen some bad reviews about it and let me remind any product junkie out there, Laura Mercier concept is having a flawless face by using her products to accentuate your natural beauty. These highlighting cream does just that. A very polish application when I pair it with my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and "baked" everything with her translucent powder. It will not give you the exaggerated highlighted look that is trending on social media.. it can if you build and set several layers.Received the Lightstruck prismatic glow palette complimentary for review purposes. I was surprised to find the pigmentation is sheer with these creams. It's different from most creams and liquid highlighters on the market today. The colors don't layer well with powder highlighters (I tried layering and ABH glow kit on top and it looked cakey and powdery) These are definitely more for a natural look and best used by themselves with little product underneath. I think i'll be using them as body highlighters, they look really pretty when fully blended out on the collarbones.I got to swatch this palette in-store today for the highlighter launch event. I was totally let down by this palette. I mean, really, is this REALLY a Laura Mercier product??! I was shocked! Let's just say that ANY, even Drugstore highlighter, whether balm, liquid, powder (doesn't matter), but drugstore ones beat this anyday! Wow, this is a horrible product n palette! :( Save ur money, Loves. I can't see using this product (any part of it) for anything! Ugh, sorry I'm usually the one that takes the time to write reviews that r positive but I wanted to warn anyone out there about just how much of a letdown this was. Still can't believe Laura Mercier put this out. :(((Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes. I absolutely love this palette! They are very easy to blend, super pigmented , and beginner friendly. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves highlighting.I actually really liked this product more than I anticipated! I thought at first that the glitter would be too chunky, and that the cream would overall be too thick and not blendable. I was so wrong! All of these shades are sheer and contribute to an all-over "glowing from within" look. I love how sheer they are- they give you a healthy flush that way.I love this product. The different shades they provide in this pallet allow you to create a few different lookes (day and night). I found that this palette allowed my face to naturally glow. the texture of the product is what i loved most. soft, creamy, and very easy to apply.This palette was sent to me complementary by Influenster for review and testing purposes. This has beautiful packaging but I'm more likely going to use it as a display than actual makeup, because the product isn't that exciting. The glow is a little glittery and not that pigmented. I also didn't find it to be buildable at all but I suppose it would be good for a subtle glow if you're into that.When I first saw this palette I was in awe. I mean, have you seen the packaging? Any way the light catches it bounces a rainbow effect right back. Once I got inside the colors were so gorgeous, the only one I was weary about was the Beam shade. Out of all of the shades, I am capable of wearing about 3 of them personally. I would not go out of my way to purchase this highlighter kit due to it being cream and I am not a big fan of the "greasy" texture on my face personally. The two lightest shades slightly make my face look ashy after a little bit.I received this from influenster free for testing purposes, and I'm so glad I did! I have been having so much fun layering the different shades to see what look I can get! I have to say aurora is my favorite because it has the least sparkle and just looks like a glow from within! I am a freelance makeup artist and can't wait to try this on clients of all skin tones!I am a very loyal to my products type of makeup girl, and have used Candlelight by Benefit as my highlighter for several years. This new glow palette has a lot of options to offer. I have only worn the Aurora over my face/eyelids with Reflect layered over it. The creaminess of this makeup makes it easy to layer on, and it doesn't feel heavy on my face.

But these are just so lightweight and bendable they dont feel heavy on the skin at all. The pigmentation is great, and i love the different shades. Aurora is definitely my favorite i to boost my radiant glow under foundation. The only downside is the fact that it does not sit on foundation well. It looks amazing underneath but on top it separates the foundation. If you gently dab it on the high points of your cheeks to highlight it doesn't separate just as long as you avoid using a blending motion. It also makes for a great base to a powder highlight for the ultimate glow.So I was sent this product for free by Influenster to review it. The packaging is stunning. The mirror inside is large and perfect for travel. It has a magnetic closure so it is good for traveling. The products insides are okay. They are cream highlights or eyeshadows. The pink, gold, and taupe shade are glory without shimmer or very little. The white shade has tiny blue glitters and the silver shade has chunky glitter, but it's not textured. Over all, if you build it up it's very beautiful and natural lookingFirst off, the packaging is gorgeous. I love the pinky blush shade in the palette. It is a warm pink with a gold reflect, it reminds me a lot of Nars orgasm. Now the gold and bronze highlights, while they are gorgeous and not chunky, they're too dark for my porcelain fair skin as highlights. However I've tried the bronze shade as like a glowy no makeup bronzer look and I enjoyed it! The biggest let down of this palette for me was that the two lighter shades are pretty unflattering. One is a chunky silver, and the other a chunky iridescent blue. You can see the glitter sitting on your face. The creams do blend out extremely easily with the fingers and once set will not move all day. So if you don't mind chunky highlights, or if you're a bit darker than me, this palette could become your new go to :) Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I like how it sits on top of powder but it's hard to love with the application process. I've been using my fingers and I'm not a fan of it, if they had a brush or sponge made of it would help a lot. I love the glow I get from the highlights. I just glow! Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.This product is an okay option for those looking for a creamy Highlighter. It is very VERY sheer and more on the glittery side. Now with the price taken into account, I'm not sure it is worth it... I'd recommend trying it in the store first. My more detailed review video is below.If you read the directions and do it right, it works wonderfully! I have combination skin and I love the smooth feel of it!despise the wide range of reviews I think this palette will be my go to highlighter for some time, I think it's quite easy and simple to use, especially since I've been preferring the wet version of highlighters recently. I use my beauty blender to blend and mix my own customized highlighting shade to achieve that natural dewy trendy look, and I love it. Also the packaging is just gorgeous as well, hard to keep my eyes off of it. 
 *I received this product complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.The texture of the product itself is creamy but by that being said it's really easy to build up the color whether you want a natural glow or a beaming highlight. I loved the variety of colors that the palette has! There's literally one for every skin tone! I also LOVED the packaging <3. Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes from Influenster. This Palette is a cream highlight Palette and with me having oily skin I was a little worried I wouldn't like it on my skin. I can't use it by itself but I DO however, use it as a base for my powder highlights to intensify them and I love it! Love the packaging as well.I am so happy of have received this complementary from Influenster for testing purposes, the colors are stunning and I am in love with this!I've been a fan of Laura Mercier cosmetics for years, and was super excited when I'd received this palette complimentary for review purposes. It is a cream palette so buildable coverage and definitely set it with setting powder before moving on. I've seen some bad reviews about it and let me remind any product junkie out there, Laura Mercier concept is having a flawless face by using her products to accentuate your natural beauty. These highlighting cream does just that. A very polish application when I pair it with my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and "baked" everything with her translucent powder. It will not give you the exaggerated highlighted look that is trending on social media.. it can if you build and set several layers.Received the Lightstruck prismatic glow palette complimentary for review purposes. I was surprised to find the pigmentation is sheer with these creams. It's different from most creams and liquid highlighters on the market today. The colors don't layer well with powder highlighters (I tried layering and ABH glow kit on top and it looked cakey and powdery) These are definitely more for a natural look and best used by themselves with little product underneath. I think i'll be using them as body highlighters, they look really pretty when fully blended out on the collarbones.I got to swatch this palette in-store today for the highlighter launch event. I was totally let down by this palette. I mean, really, is this REALLY a Laura Mercier product??! I was shocked! Let's just say that ANY, even Drugstore highlighter, whether balm, liquid, powder (doesn't matter), but drugstore ones beat this anyday! Wow, this is a horrible product n palette! :( Save ur money, Loves. I can't see using this product (any part of it) for anything! Ugh, sorry I'm usually the one that takes the time to write reviews that r positive but I wanted to warn anyone out there about just how much of a letdown this was. Still can't believe Laura Mercier put this out. :(((Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes. I absolutely love this palette! They are very easy to blend, super pigmented , and beginner friendly. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves highlighting.I actually really liked this product more than I anticipated! I thought at first that the glitter would be too chunky, and that the cream would overall be too thick and not blendable. I was so wrong! All of these shades are sheer and contribute to an all-over "glowing from within" look. I love how sheer they are- they give you a healthy flush that way.I love this product. The different shades they provide in this pallet allow you to create a few different lookes (day and night). I found that this palette allowed my face to naturally glow. the texture of the product is what i loved most. soft, creamy, and very easy to apply.This palette was sent to me complementary by Influenster for review and testing purposes. This has beautiful packaging but I'm more likely going to use it as a display than actual makeup, because the product isn't that exciting. The glow is a little glittery and not that pigmented. I also didn't find it to be buildable at all but I suppose it would be good for a subtle glow if you're into that.When I first saw this palette I was in awe. I mean, have you seen the packaging? Any way the light catches it bounces a rainbow effect right back. Once I got inside the colors were so gorgeous, the only one I was weary about was the Beam shade. Out of all of the shades, I am capable of wearing about 3 of them personally. I would not go out of my way to purchase this highlighter kit due to it being cream and I am not a big fan of the "greasy" texture on my face personally. The two lightest shades slightly make my face look ashy after a little bit.The colors of this palette are really pretty. Neutrals are my favorite so I am taking advantage of it so much! I like that they last long and that it could also be a perfect gift.When I received this product I was so excited to use it. The colors looked beautiful and would be useful for highlighting my face differently. Only when I began using the product did I become slightly dissatisfied. The consistency is almost oily. After trying the products I did not like the way it felt on my skin, greasy almost. The colors are still beautiful though, so I have to give a little to get a little!! I Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I am fairly new to highlighting my face. Originally, I was a big fan of bronzer and I used the sheen or glitter in the bronzer as a "highlighter" (lame, I know). But since getting this product, I finally realize the power and beauty of highlighting! It actually makes your face look more natural and vibrant as it draws the light towards you and makes you look radiant. The palette comes with five colors, so you can mix and match and are not consistently stuck with the same highlighter. That is my favorite thing about this product - there are more subtle colors (like ray and prism) that I can use in the daytime, but there are also darker. bolder colors that I like to use to intensify my look at night. My only issue is the lasting power, the highlight seems to fade after a few hours..maybe I need to pair it with a setting powder or primer. Overall, fantastic product and a great product to introduce people to highlighting!I received this from influenster free for testing purposes, and I'm so glad I did! I have been having so much fun layering the different shades to see what look I can get! I have to say aurora is my favorite because it has the least sparkle and just looks like a glow from within! I am a freelance makeup artist and can't wait to try this on clients of all skin tones!I am a very loyal to my products type of makeup girl, and have used Candlelight by Benefit as my highlighter for several years. This new glow palette has a lot of options to offer. I have only worn the Aurora over my face/eyelids with Reflect layered over it. The creaminess of this makeup makes it easy to layer on, and it doesn't feel heavy on my face. 
 I wore this make up on two days back to back, and despite having breakout prone skin, did not break out - which is a HUGE plus in my book. 
 Lightstruck also made my skin look fairly clear in photos - I was really happy with how this turned out. I am looking forward to another weekend out somewhere so that I can play with other looks.Honestly I haven't used cream highlighters before this one but I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, I think this palette is a little to light and sheer for my complexion but I must say Prism is definitely wearable and buildable it is the golden shade and catches the light beautifully I love it. Ray can be used as a brow bone and inner corner highlight as well.When I got this I will admit I was a little hesitant because it was a cream highlight, but i had time to play around with it and out of everything I LOVE the blush and the contour the most. The highlighters are good especially for special occasions but the blush is so beautiful on the skin and looks very dewy. This pallet is functional for everyday makeup which I like and most of the colors are build-able.

The packaging is really pretty but the product itself is not so great! I'm not a fan of cream highlighters because I have oily skin, and this formulation feels like lipstick or cream eye shadow. Also, most of the colors made me look ashy out of 5 I can only use 2. Overall, this palette isn't worth it!I really wanted to LOVE this product. I love cream highlighters but some of these shapes are just way to glittery. I use this on my face today using ray on my cheeks since that would be more of a highlight for me but it has blue chunky glitters throughout and you could really tell on my face. I ended up putting my other Laura mercier highlight in 01 to mix in on my cheekbones and that did look a little better and hid the chunky glitter. All in all this was an okay palette but I don't think it would be worth the money. 
 **Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I received this from influenster free for testing purposes, and I'm so glad I did! I have been having so much fun layering the different shades to see what look I can get! I have to say aurora is my favorite because it has the least sparkle and just looks like a glow from within! I am a freelance makeup artist and can't wait to try this on clients of all skin tones!I am a very loyal to my products type of makeup girl, and have used Candlelight by Benefit as my highlighter for several years. This new glow palette has a lot of options to offer. I have only worn the Aurora over my face/eyelids with Reflect layered over it. The creaminess of this makeup makes it easy to layer on, and it doesn't feel heavy on my face. 
 I wore this make up on two days back to back, and despite having breakout prone skin, did not break out - which is a HUGE plus in my book. 
 Lightstruck also made my skin look fairly clear in photos - I was really happy with how this turned out. I am looking forward to another weekend out somewhere so that I can play with other looks.Honestly I haven't used cream highlighters before this one but I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, I think this palette is a little to light and sheer for my complexion but I must say Prism is definitely wearable and buildable it is the golden shade and catches the light beautifully I love it. Ray can be used as a brow bone and inner corner highlight as well.When I got this I will admit I was a little hesitant because it was a cream highlight, but i had time to play around with it and out of everything I LOVE the blush and the contour the most. The highlighters are good especially for special occasions but the blush is so beautiful on the skin and looks very dewy. This pallet is functional for everyday makeup which I like and most of the colors are build-able. I received this product free for review purposesI love this product so much! first off the packaging is beautiful! it closes with a magnet and comes with a huge mirror inside. All of the shades in this palette are so beautiful! they can be stacked or worn alone! 2 of the shades on the right are very glittery the other three don't have glitter. This palette is great for that glow from within look. it blends very easily, the formula is super creamy! a little bit goes a long way.Me gusta la variedad de tonos que incluyeron en esta palette de Iluminadores, el que sean en crema, hace que el acabado en tu piel sea mas "natural" a mi punto de vista, lo único que no me gusto fue el iluminador en tono gris(plateado) los demás están perfectos.Yo recibí este producto por parte de la pagina Influenster, pero mi opinion es honesta y sincera. #gotitfree #review #honestreviewI received this free from influenster to test out and i love it! i was actually really surprised at how much i liked it because i never use cream highlighters. But these are just so lightweight and bendable they dont feel heavy on the skin at all. The pigmentation is great, and i love the different shades. Aurora is definitely my favorite i to boost my radiant glow under foundation. The only downside is the fact that it does not sit on foundation well. It looks amazing underneath but on top it separates the foundation. If you gently dab it on the high points of your cheeks to highlight it doesn't separate just as long as you avoid using a blending motion. It also makes for a great base to a powder highlight for the ultimate glow.So I was sent this product for free by Influenster to review it. The packaging is stunning. The mirror inside is large and perfect for travel. It has a magnetic closure so it is good for traveling. The products insides are okay. They are cream highlights or eyeshadows. The pink, gold, and taupe shade are glory without shimmer or very little. The white shade has tiny blue glitters and the silver shade has chunky glitter, but it's not textured. Over all, if you build it up it's very beautiful and natural lookingFirst off, the packaging is gorgeous. I love the pinky blush shade in the palette. It is a warm pink with a gold reflect, it reminds me a lot of Nars orgasm. Now the gold and bronze highlights, while they are gorgeous and not chunky, they're too dark for my porcelain fair skin as highlights. However I've tried the bronze shade as like a glowy no makeup bronzer look and I enjoyed it! The biggest let down of this palette for me was that the two lighter shades are pretty unflattering. One is a chunky silver, and the other a chunky iridescent blue. You can see the glitter sitting on your face. The creams do blend out extremely easily with the fingers and once set will not move all day. So if you don't mind chunky highlights, or if you're a bit darker than me, this palette could become your new go to :) Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I like how it sits on top of powder but it's hard to love with the application process. I've been using my fingers and I'm not a fan of it, if they had a brush or sponge made of it would help a lot. I love the glow I get from the highlights. I just glow! Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.This product is an okay option for those looking for a creamy Highlighter. It is very VERY sheer and more on the glittery side. Now with the price taken into account, I'm not sure it is worth it... I'd recommend trying it in the store first. My more detailed review video is below.If you read the directions and do it right, it works wonderfully! I have combination skin and I love the smooth feel of it!despise the wide range of reviews I think this palette will be my go to highlighter for some time, I think it's quite easy and simple to use, especially since I've been preferring the wet version of highlighters recently. I use my beauty blender to blend and mix my own customized highlighting shade to achieve that natural dewy trendy look, and I love it. Also the packaging is just gorgeous as well, hard to keep my eyes off of it. 
 *I received this product complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.The texture of the product itself is creamy but by that being said it's really easy to build up the color whether you want a natural glow or a beaming highlight. I loved the variety of colors that the palette has! There's literally one for every skin tone! I also LOVED the packaging <3. Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes from Influenster. This Palette is a cream highlight Palette and with me having oily skin I was a little worried I wouldn't like it on my skin. I can't use it by itself but I DO however, use it as a base for my powder highlights to intensify them and I love it! Love the packaging as well.I am so happy of have received this complementary from Influenster for testing purposes, the colors are stunning and I am in love with this!I've been a fan of Laura Mercier cosmetics for years, and was super excited when I'd received this palette complimentary for review purposes. It is a cream palette so buildable coverage and definitely set it with setting powder before moving on. I've seen some bad reviews about it and let me remind any product junkie out there, Laura Mercier concept is having a flawless face by using her products to accentuate your natural beauty. These highlighting cream does just that. A very polish application when I pair it with my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and "baked" everything with her translucent powder. It will not give you the exaggerated highlighted look that is trending on social media.. it can if you build and set several layers.Received the Lightstruck prismatic glow palette complimentary for review purposes. I was surprised to find the pigmentation is sheer with these creams. It's different from most creams and liquid highlighters on the market today. The colors don't layer well with powder highlighters (I tried layering and ABH glow kit on top and it looked cakey and powdery) These are definitely more for a natural look and best used by themselves with little product underneath. I think i'll be using them as body highlighters, they look really pretty when fully blended out on the collarbones.I got to swatch this palette in-store today for the highlighter launch event. I was totally let down by this palette. I mean, really, is this REALLY a Laura Mercier product??! I was shocked! Let's just say that ANY, even Drugstore highlighter, whether balm, liquid, powder (doesn't matter), but drugstore ones beat this anyday! Wow, this is a horrible product n palette! :( Save ur money, Loves. I can't see using this product (any part of it) for anything! Ugh, sorry I'm usually the one that takes the time to write reviews that r positive but I wanted to warn anyone out there about just how much of a letdown this was. Still can't believe Laura Mercier put this out. :(((Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes. I absolutely love this palette! They are very easy to blend, super pigmented , and beginner friendly. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves highlighting.I actually really liked this product more than I anticipated! I thought at first that the glitter would be too chunky, and that the cream would overall be too thick and not blendable. I was so wrong! All of these shades are sheer and contribute to an all-over "glowing from within" look. I love how sheer they are- they give you a healthy flush that way.I love this product. The different shades they provide in this pallet allow you to create a few different lookes (day and night). I found that this palette allowed my face to naturally glow. the texture of the product is what i loved most. soft, creamy, and very easy to apply.This palette was sent to me complementary by Influenster for review and testing purposes. This has beautiful packaging but I'm more likely going to use it as a display than actual makeup, because the product isn't that exciting. The glow is a little glittery and not that pigmented. I also didn't find it to be buildable at all but I suppose it would be good for a subtle glow if you're into that.When I first saw this palette I was in awe. I mean, have you seen the packaging? Any way the light catches it bounces a rainbow effect right back. Once I got inside the colors were so gorgeous, the only one I was weary about was the Beam shade. Out of all of the shades, I am capable of wearing about 3 of them personally. I would not go out of my way to purchase this highlighter kit due to it being cream and I am not a big fan of the "greasy" texture on my face personally. The two lightest shades slightly make my face look ashy after a little bit.The colors of this palette are really pretty. Neutrals are my favorite so I am taking advantage of it so much! I like that they last long and that it could also be a perfect gift.When I received this product I was so excited to use it. The colors looked beautiful and would be useful for highlighting my face differently. Only when I began using the product did I become slightly dissatisfied. The consistency is almost oily. After trying the products I did not like the way it felt on my skin, greasy almost. The colors are still beautiful though, so I have to give a little to get a little!! I Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I am fairly new to highlighting my face. Originally, I was a big fan of bronzer and I used the sheen or glitter in the bronzer as a "highlighter" (lame, I know). But since getting this product, I finally realize the power and beauty of highlighting! It actually makes your face look more natural and vibrant as it draws the light towards you and makes you look radiant. The palette comes with five colors, so you can mix and match and are not consistently stuck with the same highlighter. That is my favorite thing about this product - there are more subtle colors (like ray and prism) that I can use in the daytime, but there are also darker. bolder colors that I like to use to intensify my look at night. My only issue is the lasting power, the highlight seems to fade after a few hours..maybe I need to pair it with a setting powder or primer. Overall, fantastic product and a great product to introduce people to highlighting!I just received the Laura MercierLightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette in the mail.

 **Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I loved this palette. The colors were great on my skin town and had just the right amount of shimmer. The only thing I did not love about this palette was the bronzer. The bronzer was very sheer and hard to work with.I love this product! It is great for highlighting newbies, as it provides very soft, easy to blend shimmer. However, it's easy to layer for a more dramatic night time look.

 To start off, I'm quite familiar with LM and their products but sadly this does not match. The top right two shades are far too glittery (think little girl's makeup palette) and will not work as a highlight - maybe as a base for eyeshadow. While the formula is great, this type of product works best using the warmth of your fingertips and not a brush. For an overall dewy look, I use all shades except the two glittery ones as blush, bronzer and highlight over primed skin and then add my foundation on top. It gives a wonderful glow from within and dimension to the face.I love this product! It is great for highlighting newbies, as it provides very soft, easy to blend shimmer.

 Initially when I looked at the colors I didn't think this would be a cohesive palette. Thr formula is very sheer with the ability to build. For those looking to blind with their highlight, this would make a great base. It is quite creamy so for those with oily skin I'd suggest using a good mattifying primer unless you really life the dewy look.

It's card board material, and for the price tag you're paying you kinda feel ripped off. 
 As for the actual product, well it's kinda hit or miss. Some of them are nice others are just specs of glitter. All in all, there's nothing really impressive about this palette.I received this product complimentary from Influenster and when I tried it I was honestly pleasantly surprised by how pretty and versatile this palette is. As someone with very oily skin I would not normally reach for a cream highlighting palette, but I decided to give it a try for a night out in the city and put it to the test. Aurora is a really beautiful blush shade and looked pretty built up with Ray as a highlight on top of my cheekbones. I wore Beam as an overall eyeshadow, and would definitely recommend a primer if you have oily eyelids because at the end of the night the product was barely there... but the metallic shine was incredible! My favorite shade is Ray, it is such pretty all over highlight and looks STUNNING as an inner corner highlight shade. The trick to making this palette last is setting your foundation with powder and using primer before you go in with this product. If you do these crucial steps before I think this palette is really pretty and perfect for someone who likes the convenience and ease of a versatile palette.I received this from influenster free for testing purposes, and I'm so glad I did! I have been having so much fun layering the different shades to see what look I can get! I have to say aurora is my favorite because it has the least sparkle and just looks like a glow from within! I am a freelance makeup artist and can't wait to try this on clients of all skin tones!I am a very loyal to my products type of makeup girl, and have used Candlelight by Benefit as my highlighter for several years. This new glow palette has a lot of options to offer. I have only worn the Aurora over my face/eyelids with Reflect layered over it. The creaminess of this makeup makes it easy to layer on, and it doesn't feel heavy on my face. 
 I wore this make up on two days back to back, and despite having breakout prone skin, did not break out - which is a HUGE plus in my book. 
 Lightstruck also made my skin look fairly clear in photos - I was really happy with how this turned out. I am looking forward to another weekend out somewhere so that I can play with other looks.I love this product! It is great for highlighting newbies, as it provides very soft, easy to blend shimmer. However, it's easy to layer for a more dramatic night time look. A little goes a long way, so this palette will last a long time!The packaging alone is to die for! The colors aren't typically what i would reach for but once i switched them i loved all of them! they're supper blend able and creamy. You can layer them on to create a more intense hight light and the pigment is sheer. The shimmer is intense but the colors itself blend out very well.

 To start off, I'm quite familiar with LM and their products but sadly this does not match. The top right two shades are far too glittery (think little girl's makeup palette) and will not work as a highlight - maybe as a base for eyeshadow. While the formula is great, this type of product works best using the warmth of your fingertips and not a brush. For an overall dewy look, I use all shades except the two glittery ones as blush, bronzer and highlight over primed skin and then add my foundation on top. It gives a wonderful glow from within and dimension to the face.I am loving this palette! I was pleasantly surprised when I got it, as it's super easy to apply. At first, I was nervous, as I tend to stay away from highlighters (due to my semi-oily skin), but was happy to see that this didn't make me appear super shiny. Each color provides the perfect amount of glow and each shade is build-able. I'd say it lasted throughout the day, for the most part and I like that even though it's a cream-base, it's not greasy. It also looks super natural and has not made me breakout, which is always a plus...!

 Initially when I looked at the colors I didn't think this would be a cohesive palette. Thr formula is very sheer with the ability to build. For those looking to blind with their highlight, this would make a great base. It is quite creamy so for those with oily skin I'd suggest using a good mattifying primer unless you really life the dewy look.

But these are just so lightweight and bendable they dont feel heavy on the skin at all. The pigmentation is great, and i love the different shades. Aurora is definitely my favorite i to boost my radiant glow under foundation. The only downside is the fact that it does not sit on foundation well. It looks amazing underneath but on top it separates the foundation. If you gently dab it on the high points of your cheeks to highlight it doesn't separate just as long as you avoid using a blending motion. It also makes for a great base to a powder highlight for the ultimate glow.I love this product! It is great for highlighting newbies, as it provides very soft, easy to blend shimmer.

For an overall dewy look, I use all shades except the two glittery ones as blush, bronzer and highlight over primed skin and then add my foundation on top. It gives a wonderful glow from within and dimension to the face.I am loving this palette! I was pleasantly surprised when I got it, as it's super easy to apply. At first, I was nervous, as I tend to stay away from highlighters (due to my semi-oily skin), but was happy to see that this didn't make me appear super shiny. Each color provides the perfect amount of glow and each shade is build-able. I'd say it lasted throughout the day, for the most part and I like that even though it's a cream-base, it's not greasy. It also looks super natural and has not made me breakout, which is always a plus...!
 I received this product complimentary through Influenster.Received this courtesy of influenster for reviewing purposes.
 Initially when I looked at the colors I didn't think this would be a cohesive palette. Thr formula is very sheer with the ability to build. For those looking to blind with their highlight, this would make a great base. It is quite creamy so for those with oily skin I'd suggest using a good mattifying primer unless you really life the dewy look. This is meant to be used with the fingers, in order to get the shimmer from the product. Usinga brush will make you look oily. All the colors are really gorgeous. I like it but I think the formula can be make or break for some people.First of all, I was shocked by the packaging. Although it looked nice in the pictures, IRL it's cheaply made. It's card board material, and for the price tag you're paying you kinda feel ripped off. 
 As for the actual product, well it's kinda hit or miss. Some of them are nice others are just specs of glitter. All in all, there's nothing really impressive about this palette.I received this product complimentary from Influenster and when I tried it I was honestly pleasantly surprised by how pretty and versatile this palette is. As someone with very oily skin I would not normally reach for a cream highlighting palette, but I decided to give it a try for a night out in the city and put it to the test. Aurora is a really beautiful blush shade and looked pretty built up with Ray as a highlight on top of my cheekbones. I wore Beam as an overall eyeshadow, and would definitely recommend a primer if you have oily eyelids because at the end of the night the product was barely there... but the metallic shine was incredible! My favorite shade is Ray, it is such pretty all over highlight and looks STUNNING as an inner corner highlight shade. The trick to making this palette last is setting your foundation with powder and using primer before you go in with this product. If you do these crucial steps before I think this palette is really pretty and perfect for someone who likes the convenience and ease of a versatile palette.I received this from influenster free for testing purposes, and I'm so glad I did! I have been having so much fun layering the different shades to see what look I can get! I have to say aurora is my favorite because it has the least sparkle and just looks like a glow from within! I am a freelance makeup artist and can't wait to try this on clients of all skin tones!I am a very loyal to my products type of makeup girl, and have used Candlelight by Benefit as my highlighter for several years. This new glow palette has a lot of options to offer. I have only worn the Aurora over my face/eyelids with Reflect layered over it. The creaminess of this makeup makes it easy to layer on, and it doesn't feel heavy on my face. 
 I wore this make up on two days back to back, and despite having breakout prone skin, did not break out - which is a HUGE plus in my book. 
 Lightstruck also made my skin look fairly clear in photos - I was really happy with how this turned out. I am looking forward to another weekend out somewhere so that I can play with other looks.Honestly I haven't used cream highlighters before this one but I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, I think this palette is a little to light and sheer for my complexion but I must say Prism is definitely wearable and buildable it is the golden shade and catches the light beautifully I love it. Ray can be used as a brow bone and inner corner highlight as well.When I got this I will admit I was a little hesitant because it was a cream highlight, but i had time to play around with it and out of everything I LOVE the blush and the contour the most. The highlighters are good especially for special occasions but the blush is so beautiful on the skin and looks very dewy. This pallet is functional for everyday makeup which I like and most of the colors are build-able. I received this product free for review purposesI love this product so much! first off the packaging is beautiful! it closes with a magnet and comes with a huge mirror inside. All of the shades in this palette are so beautiful! they can be stacked or worn alone! 2 of the shades on the right are very glittery the other three don't have glitter. This palette is great for that glow from within look. it blends very easily, the formula is super creamy! a little bit goes a long way.Me gusta la variedad de tonos que incluyeron en esta palette de Iluminadores, el que sean en crema, hace que el acabado en tu piel sea mas "natural" a mi punto de vista, lo único que no me gusto fue el iluminador en tono gris(plateado) los demás están perfectos.Yo recibí este producto por parte de la pagina Influenster, pero mi opinion es honesta y sincera. #gotitfree #review #honestreviewI received this free from influenster to test out and i love it! i was actually really surprised at how much i liked it because i never use cream highlighters. But these are just so lightweight and bendable they dont feel heavy on the skin at all. The pigmentation is great, and i love the different shades. Aurora is definitely my favorite i to boost my radiant glow under foundation. The only downside is the fact that it does not sit on foundation well. It looks amazing underneath but on top it separates the foundation. If you gently dab it on the high points of your cheeks to highlight it doesn't separate just as long as you avoid using a blending motion. It also makes for a great base to a powder highlight for the ultimate glow.So I was sent this product for free by Influenster to review it. The packaging is stunning. The mirror inside is large and perfect for travel. It has a magnetic closure so it is good for traveling. The products insides are okay. They are cream highlights or eyeshadows. The pink, gold, and taupe shade are glory without shimmer or very little. The white shade has tiny blue glitters and the silver shade has chunky glitter, but it's not textured. Over all, if you build it up it's very beautiful and natural lookingI love this product! It is great for highlighting newbies, as it provides very soft, easy to blend shimmer. However, it's easy to layer for a more dramatic night time look. A little goes a long way, so this palette will last a long time!The packaging alone is to die for! The colors aren't typically what i would reach for but once i switched them i loved all of them! they're supper blend able and creamy. You can layer them on to create a more intense hight light and the pigment is sheer. The shimmer is intense but the colors itself blend out very well.

Now the gold and bronze highlights, while they are gorgeous and not chunky, they're too dark for my porcelain fair skin as highlights. However I've tried the bronze shade as like a glowy no makeup bronzer look and I enjoyed it! The biggest let down of this palette for me was that the two lighter shades are pretty unflattering. One is a chunky silver, and the other a chunky iridescent blue. You can see the glitter sitting on your face. The creams do blend out extremely easily with the fingers and once set will not move all day.

The top right two shades are far too glittery (think little girl's makeup palette) and will not work as a highlight - maybe as a base for eyeshadow. While the formula is great, this type of product works best using the warmth of your fingertips and not a brush. For an overall dewy look, I use all shades except the two glittery ones as blush, bronzer and highlight over primed skin and then add my foundation on top. It gives a wonderful glow from within and dimension to the face.I am loving this palette! I was pleasantly surprised when I got it, as it's super easy to apply. At first, I was nervous, as I tend to stay away from highlighters (due to my semi-oily skin), but was happy to see that this didn't make me appear super shiny. Each color provides the perfect amount of glow and each shade is build-able. I'd say it lasted throughout the day, for the most part and I like that even though it's a cream-base, it's not greasy. It also looks super natural and has not made me breakout, which is always a plus...!

 Initially when I looked at the colors I didn't think this would be a cohesive palette. Thr formula is very sheer with the ability to build. For those looking to blind with their highlight, this would make a great base. It is quite creamy so for those with oily skin I'd suggest using a good mattifying primer unless you really life the dewy look. This is meant to be used with the fingers, in order to get the shimmer from the product. Usinga brush will make you look oily. All the colors are really gorgeous. I like it but I think the formula can be make or break for some people.First of all, I was shocked by the packaging. Although it looked nice in the pictures, IRL it's cheaply made. It's card board material, and for the price tag you're paying you kinda feel ripped off. 
 As for the actual product, well it's kinda hit or miss. Some of them are nice others are just specs of glitter. All in all, there's nothing really impressive about this palette.I received this product complimentary from Influenster and when I tried it I was honestly pleasantly surprised by how pretty and versatile this palette is. As someone with very oily skin I would not normally reach for a cream highlighting palette, but I decided to give it a try for a night out in the city and put it to the test. Aurora is a really beautiful blush shade and looked pretty built up with Ray as a highlight on top of my cheekbones. I wore Beam as an overall eyeshadow, and would definitely recommend a primer if you have oily eyelids because at the end of the night the product was barely there... but the metallic shine was incredible! My favorite shade is Ray, it is such pretty all over highlight and looks STUNNING as an inner corner highlight shade. The trick to making this palette last is setting your foundation with powder and using primer before you go in with this product. If you do these crucial steps before I think this palette is really pretty and perfect for someone who likes the convenience and ease of a versatile palette.I received this from influenster free for testing purposes, and I'm so glad I did! I have been having so much fun layering the different shades to see what look I can get! I have to say aurora is my favorite because it has the least sparkle and just looks like a glow from within! I am a freelance makeup artist and can't wait to try this on clients of all skin tones!I am a very loyal to my products type of makeup girl, and have used Candlelight by Benefit as my highlighter for several years. This new glow palette has a lot of options to offer. I have only worn the Aurora over my face/eyelids with Reflect layered over it. The creaminess of this makeup makes it easy to layer on, and it doesn't feel heavy on my face. 
 I wore this make up on two days back to back, and despite having breakout prone skin, did not break out - which is a HUGE plus in my book. 
 Lightstruck also made my skin look fairly clear in photos - I was really happy with how this turned out. I am looking forward to another weekend out somewhere so that I can play with other looks.Honestly I haven't used cream highlighters before this one but I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, I think this palette is a little to light and sheer for my complexion but I must say Prism is definitely wearable and buildable it is the golden shade and catches the light beautifully I love it. Ray can be used as a brow bone and inner corner highlight as well.When I got this I will admit I was a little hesitant because it was a cream highlight, but i had time to play around with it and out of everything I LOVE the blush and the contour the most. The highlighters are good especially for special occasions but the blush is so beautiful on the skin and looks very dewy. This pallet is functional for everyday makeup which I like and most of the colors are build-able. I received this product free for review purposesI love this product so much! first off the packaging is beautiful! it closes with a magnet and comes with a huge mirror inside. All of the shades in this palette are so beautiful! they can be stacked or worn alone! 2 of the shades on the right are very glittery the other three don't have glitter. This palette is great for that glow from within look. it blends very easily, the formula is super creamy! a little bit goes a long way.Me gusta la variedad de tonos que incluyeron en esta palette de Iluminadores, el que sean en crema, hace que el acabado en tu piel sea mas "natural" a mi punto de vista, lo único que no me gusto fue el iluminador en tono gris(plateado) los demás están perfectos.Yo recibí este producto por parte de la pagina Influenster, pero mi opinion es honesta y sincera. #gotitfree #review #honestreviewI received this free from influenster to test out and i love it! i was actually really surprised at how much i liked it because i never use cream highlighters. But these are just so lightweight and bendable they dont feel heavy on the skin at all. The pigmentation is great, and i love the different shades. Aurora is definitely my favorite i to boost my radiant glow under foundation. The only downside is the fact that it does not sit on foundation well. It looks amazing underneath but on top it separates the foundation. If you gently dab it on the high points of your cheeks to highlight it doesn't separate just as long as you avoid using a blending motion. It also makes for a great base to a powder highlight for the ultimate glow.So I was sent this product for free by Influenster to review it. The packaging is stunning. The mirror inside is large and perfect for travel. It has a magnetic closure so it is good for traveling. The products insides are okay. They are cream highlights or eyeshadows. The pink, gold, and taupe shade are glory without shimmer or very little. The white shade has tiny blue glitters and the silver shade has chunky glitter, but it's not textured. Over all, if you build it up it's very beautiful and natural lookingFirst off, the packaging is gorgeous. I love the pinky blush shade in the palette. It is a warm pink with a gold reflect, it reminds me a lot of Nars orgasm. Now the gold and bronze highlights, while they are gorgeous and not chunky, they're too dark for my porcelain fair skin as highlights. However I've tried the bronze shade as like a glowy no makeup bronzer look and I enjoyed it! The biggest let down of this palette for me was that the two lighter shades are pretty unflattering. One is a chunky silver, and the other a chunky iridescent blue. You can see the glitter sitting on your face. The creams do blend out extremely easily with the fingers and once set will not move all day. So if you don't mind chunky highlights, or if you're a bit darker than me, this palette could become your new go to :) Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I like how it sits on top of powder but it's hard to love with the application process. I've been using my fingers and I'm not a fan of it, if they had a brush or sponge made of it would help a lot. I love the glow I get from the highlights. I just glow! Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.This product is an okay option for those looking for a creamy Highlighter. It is very VERY sheer and more on the glittery side. Now with the price taken into account, I'm not sure it is worth it... I'd recommend trying it in the store first. My more detailed review video is below.If you read the directions and do it right, it works wonderfully! I have combination skin and I love the smooth feel of it!I love this product! It is great for highlighting newbies, as it provides very soft, easy to blend shimmer. However, it's easy to layer for a more dramatic night time look. A little goes a long way, so this palette will last a long time!The packaging alone is to die for! The colors aren't typically what i would reach for but once i switched them i loved all of them! they're supper blend able and creamy. You can layer them on to create a more intense hight light and the pigment is sheer. The shimmer is intense but the colors itself blend out very well.

I received this product free for review purposesI love this product so much! first off the packaging is beautiful! it closes with a magnet and comes with a huge mirror inside. All of the shades in this palette are so beautiful! they can be stacked or worn alone! 2 of the shades on the right are very glittery the other three don't have glitter. This palette is great for that glow from within look. it blends very easily, the formula is super creamy! a little bit goes a long way.Me gusta la variedad de tonos que incluyeron en esta palette de Iluminadores, el que sean en crema, hace que el acabado en tu piel sea mas "natural" a mi punto de vista, lo único que no me gusto fue el iluminador en tono gris(plateado) los demás están perfectos.Yo recibí este producto por parte de la pagina Influenster, pero mi opinion es honesta y sincera. #gotitfree #review #honestreviewI received this free from influenster to test out and i love it! i was actually really surprised at how much i liked it because i never use cream highlighters. But these are just so lightweight and bendable they dont feel heavy on the skin at all. The pigmentation is great, and i love the different shades. Aurora is definitely my favorite i to boost my radiant glow under foundation. The only downside is the fact that it does not sit on foundation well. It looks amazing underneath but on top it separates the foundation. If you gently dab it on the high points of your cheeks to highlight it doesn't separate just as long as you avoid using a blending motion. It also makes for a great base to a powder highlight for the ultimate glow.So I was sent this product for free by Influenster to review it. The packaging is stunning. The mirror inside is large and perfect for travel. It has a magnetic closure so it is good for traveling. The products insides are okay. They are cream highlights or eyeshadows. The pink, gold, and taupe shade are glory without shimmer or very little. The white shade has tiny blue glitters and the silver shade has chunky glitter, but it's not textured. Over all, if you build it up it's very beautiful and natural lookingFirst off, the packaging is gorgeous. I love the pinky blush shade in the palette. It is a warm pink with a gold reflect, it reminds me a lot of Nars orgasm. Now the gold and bronze highlights, while they are gorgeous and not chunky, they're too dark for my porcelain fair skin as highlights. However I've tried the bronze shade as like a glowy no makeup bronzer look and I enjoyed it! The biggest let down of this palette for me was that the two lighter shades are pretty unflattering. One is a chunky silver, and the other a chunky iridescent blue. You can see the glitter sitting on your face. The creams do blend out extremely easily with the fingers and once set will not move all day. So if you don't mind chunky highlights, or if you're a bit darker than me, this palette could become your new go to :) Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I like how it sits on top of powder but it's hard to love with the application process. I've been using my fingers and I'm not a fan of it, if they had a brush or sponge made of it would help a lot. I love the glow I get from the highlights. I just glow! Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.This product is an okay option for those looking for a creamy Highlighter. It is very VERY sheer and more on the glittery side. Now with the price taken into account, I'm not sure it is worth it... I'd recommend trying it in the store first. My more detailed review video is below.If you read the directions and do it right, it works wonderfully! I have combination skin and I love the smooth feel of it!despise the wide range of reviews I think this palette will be my go to highlighter for some time, I think it's quite easy and simple to use, especially since I've been preferring the wet version of highlighters recently. I use my beauty blender to blend and mix my own customized highlighting shade to achieve that natural dewy trendy look, and I love it. Also the packaging is just gorgeous as well, hard to keep my eyes off of it. 
 *I received this product complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.The texture of the product itself is creamy but by that being said it's really easy to build up the color whether you want a natural glow or a beaming highlight. I loved the variety of colors that the palette has! There's literally one for every skin tone! I also LOVED the packaging <3. Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes from Influenster. This Palette is a cream highlight Palette and with me having oily skin I was a little worried I wouldn't like it on my skin. I can't use it by itself but I DO however, use it as a base for my powder highlights to intensify them and I love it! Love the packaging as well.I love this product! It is great for highlighting newbies, as it provides very soft, easy to blend shimmer. However, it's easy to layer for a more dramatic night time look. A little goes a long way, so this palette will last a long time!The packaging alone is to die for! The colors aren't typically what i would reach for but once i switched them i loved all of them! they're supper blend able and creamy. You can layer them on to create a more intense hight light and the pigment is sheer. The shimmer is intense but the colors itself blend out very well. Received the Lightstruck Pristamistic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposesI received this palette courtesy of Influenster for reviewing purposes. 
 To start off, I'm quite familiar with LM and their products but sadly this does not match. The top right two shades are far too glittery (think little girl's makeup palette) and will not work as a highlight - maybe as a base for eyeshadow. While the formula is great, this type of product works best using the warmth of your fingertips and not a brush. For an overall dewy look, I use all shades except the two glittery ones as blush, bronzer and highlight over primed skin and then add my foundation on top. It gives a wonderful glow from within and dimension to the face.I am loving this palette! I was pleasantly surprised when I got it, as it's super easy to apply. At first, I was nervous, as I tend to stay away from highlighters (due to my semi-oily skin), but was happy to see that this didn't make me appear super shiny. Each color provides the perfect amount of glow and each shade is build-able. I'd say it lasted throughout the day, for the most part and I like that even though it's a cream-base, it's not greasy. It also looks super natural and has not made me breakout, which is always a plus...!

 Initially when I looked at the colors I didn't think this would be a cohesive palette. Thr formula is very sheer with the ability to build. For those looking to blind with their highlight, this would make a great base. It is quite creamy so for those with oily skin I'd suggest using a good mattifying primer unless you really life the dewy look. This is meant to be used with the fingers, in order to get the shimmer from the product. Usinga brush will make you look oily. All the colors are really gorgeous. I like it but I think the formula can be make or break for some people.First of all, I was shocked by the packaging. Although it looked nice in the pictures, IRL it's cheaply made. It's card board material, and for the price tag you're paying you kinda feel ripped off. 
 As for the actual product, well it's kinda hit or miss. Some of them are nice others are just specs of glitter. All in all, there's nothing really impressive about this palette.I received this product complimentary from Influenster and when I tried it I was honestly pleasantly surprised by how pretty and versatile this palette is. As someone with very oily skin I would not normally reach for a cream highlighting palette, but I decided to give it a try for a night out in the city and put it to the test. Aurora is a really beautiful blush shade and looked pretty built up with Ray as a highlight on top of my cheekbones. I wore Beam as an overall eyeshadow, and would definitely recommend a primer if you have oily eyelids because at the end of the night the product was barely there... but the metallic shine was incredible! My favorite shade is Ray, it is such pretty all over highlight and looks STUNNING as an inner corner highlight shade. The trick to making this palette last is setting your foundation with powder and using primer before you go in with this product. If you do these crucial steps before I think this palette is really pretty and perfect for someone who likes the convenience and ease of a versatile palette.I received this from influenster free for testing purposes, and I'm so glad I did! I have been having so much fun layering the different shades to see what look I can get! I have to say aurora is my favorite because it has the least sparkle and just looks like a glow from within! I am a freelance makeup artist and can't wait to try this on clients of all skin tones!I am a very loyal to my products type of makeup girl, and have used Candlelight by Benefit as my highlighter for several years. This new glow palette has a lot of options to offer. I have only worn the Aurora over my face/eyelids with Reflect layered over it. The creaminess of this makeup makes it easy to layer on, and it doesn't feel heavy on my face. 
 I wore this make up on two days back to back, and despite having breakout prone skin, did not break out - which is a HUGE plus in my book. 
 Lightstruck also made my skin look fairly clear in photos - I was really happy with how this turned out. I am looking forward to another weekend out somewhere so that I can play with other looks.Honestly I haven't used cream highlighters before this one but I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, I think this palette is a little to light and sheer for my complexion but I must say Prism is definitely wearable and buildable it is the golden shade and catches the light beautifully I love it. Ray can be used as a brow bone and inner corner highlight as well.When I got this I will admit I was a little hesitant because it was a cream highlight, but i had time to play around with it and out of everything I LOVE the blush and the contour the most.

It is a cream palette so buildable coverage and definitely set it with setting powder before moving on. I've seen some bad reviews about it and let me remind any product junkie out there, Laura Mercier concept is having a flawless face by using her products to accentuate your natural beauty. These highlighting cream does just that. A very polish application when I pair it with my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and "baked" everything with her translucent powder. It will not give you the exaggerated highlighted look that is trending on social media.. it can if you build and set several layers.I love this product!

The pink, gold, and taupe shade are glory without shimmer or very little. The white shade has tiny blue glitters and the silver shade has chunky glitter, but it's not textured. Over all, if you build it up it's very beautiful and natural lookingFirst off, the packaging is gorgeous. I love the pinky blush shade in the palette. It is a warm pink with a gold reflect, it reminds me a lot of Nars orgasm. Now the gold and bronze highlights, while they are gorgeous and not chunky, they're too dark for my porcelain fair skin as highlights. However I've tried the bronze shade as like a glowy no makeup bronzer look and I enjoyed it! The biggest let down of this palette for me was that the two lighter shades are pretty unflattering. One is a chunky silver, and the other a chunky iridescent blue. You can see the glitter sitting on your face. The creams do blend out extremely easily with the fingers and once set will not move all day. So if you don't mind chunky highlights, or if you're a bit darker than me, this palette could become your new go to :) Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I like how it sits on top of powder but it's hard to love with the application process. I've been using my fingers and I'm not a fan of it, if they had a brush or sponge made of it would help a lot. I love the glow I get from the highlights. I just glow! Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.This product is an okay option for those looking for a creamy Highlighter. It is very VERY sheer and more on the glittery side. Now with the price taken into account, I'm not sure it is worth it... I'd recommend trying it in the store first. My more detailed review video is below.If you read the directions and do it right, it works wonderfully! I have combination skin and I love the smooth feel of it!despise the wide range of reviews I think this palette will be my go to highlighter for some time, I think it's quite easy and simple to use, especially since I've been preferring the wet version of highlighters recently. I use my beauty blender to blend and mix my own customized highlighting shade to achieve that natural dewy trendy look, and I love it. Also the packaging is just gorgeous as well, hard to keep my eyes off of it. 
 *I received this product complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.The texture of the product itself is creamy but by that being said it's really easy to build up the color whether you want a natural glow or a beaming highlight. I loved the variety of colors that the palette has! There's literally one for every skin tone! I also LOVED the packaging <3. Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes from Influenster. This Palette is a cream highlight Palette and with me having oily skin I was a little worried I wouldn't like it on my skin. I can't use it by itself but I DO however, use it as a base for my powder highlights to intensify them and I love it! Love the packaging as well.I am so happy of have received this complementary from Influenster for testing purposes, the colors are stunning and I am in love with this!I've been a fan of Laura Mercier cosmetics for years, and was super excited when I'd received this palette complimentary for review purposes. It is a cream palette so buildable coverage and definitely set it with setting powder before moving on. I've seen some bad reviews about it and let me remind any product junkie out there, Laura Mercier concept is having a flawless face by using her products to accentuate your natural beauty. These highlighting cream does just that. A very polish application when I pair it with my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and "baked" everything with her translucent powder. It will not give you the exaggerated highlighted look that is trending on social media.. it can if you build and set several layers.Received the Lightstruck prismatic glow palette complimentary for review purposes. I was surprised to find the pigmentation is sheer with these creams. It's different from most creams and liquid highlighters on the market today. The colors don't layer well with powder highlighters (I tried layering and ABH glow kit on top and it looked cakey and powdery) These are definitely more for a natural look and best used by themselves with little product underneath. I think i'll be using them as body highlighters, they look really pretty when fully blended out on the collarbones.I love this product! It is great for highlighting newbies, as it provides very soft, easy to blend shimmer. However, it's easy to layer for a more dramatic night time look. A little goes a long way, so this palette will last a long time!The packaging alone is to die for! The colors aren't typically what i would reach for but once i switched them i loved all of them! they're supper blend able and creamy. You can layer them on to create a more intense hight light and the pigment is sheer. The shimmer is intense but the colors itself blend out very well.

 To start off, I'm quite familiar with LM and their products but sadly this does not match. The top right two shades are far too glittery (think little girl's makeup palette) and will not work as a highlight - maybe as a base for eyeshadow. While the formula is great, this type of product works best using the warmth of your fingertips and not a brush. For an overall dewy look, I use all shades except the two glittery ones as blush, bronzer and highlight over primed skin and then add my foundation on top. It gives a wonderful glow from within and dimension to the face.I am loving this palette! I was pleasantly surprised when I got it, as it's super easy to apply. At first, I was nervous, as I tend to stay away from highlighters (due to my semi-oily skin), but was happy to see that this didn't make me appear super shiny. Each color provides the perfect amount of glow and each shade is build-able. I'd say it lasted throughout the day, for the most part and I like that even though it's a cream-base, it's not greasy. It also looks super natural and has not made me breakout, which is always a plus...!

 Initially when I looked at the colors I didn't think this would be a cohesive palette. Thr formula is very sheer with the ability to build. For those looking to blind with their highlight, this would make a great base. It is quite creamy so for those with oily skin I'd suggest using a good mattifying primer unless you really life the dewy look. This is meant to be used with the fingers, in order to get the shimmer from the product. Usinga brush will make you look oily. All the colors are really gorgeous. I like it but I think the formula can be make or break for some people.First of all, I was shocked by the packaging. Although it looked nice in the pictures, IRL it's cheaply made. It's card board material, and for the price tag you're paying you kinda feel ripped off. 
 As for the actual product, well it's kinda hit or miss. Some of them are nice others are just specs of glitter. All in all, there's nothing really impressive about this palette.I received this product complimentary from Influenster and when I tried it I was honestly pleasantly surprised by how pretty and versatile this palette is. As someone with very oily skin I would not normally reach for a cream highlighting palette, but I decided to give it a try for a night out in the city and put it to the test. Aurora is a really beautiful blush shade and looked pretty built up with Ray as a highlight on top of my cheekbones. I wore Beam as an overall eyeshadow, and would definitely recommend a primer if you have oily eyelids because at the end of the night the product was barely there... but the metallic shine was incredible! My favorite shade is Ray, it is such pretty all over highlight and looks STUNNING as an inner corner highlight shade. The trick to making this palette last is setting your foundation with powder and using primer before you go in with this product. If you do these crucial steps before I think this palette is really pretty and perfect for someone who likes the convenience and ease of a versatile palette.I received this from influenster free for testing purposes, and I'm so glad I did! I have been having so much fun layering the different shades to see what look I can get! I have to say aurora is my favorite because it has the least sparkle and just looks like a glow from within! I am a freelance makeup artist and can't wait to try this on clients of all skin tones!I am a very loyal to my products type of makeup girl, and have used Candlelight by Benefit as my highlighter for several years. This new glow palette has a lot of options to offer. I have only worn the Aurora over my face/eyelids with Reflect layered over it. The creaminess of this makeup makes it easy to layer on, and it doesn't feel heavy on my face. 
 I wore this make up on two days back to back, and despite having breakout prone skin, did not break out - which is a HUGE plus in my book. 
 Lightstruck also made my skin look fairly clear in photos - I was really happy with how this turned out. I am looking forward to another weekend out somewhere so that I can play with other looks.Honestly I haven't used cream highlighters before this one but I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, I think this palette is a little to light and sheer for my complexion but I must say Prism is definitely wearable and buildable it is the golden shade and catches the light beautifully I love it. Ray can be used as a brow bone and inner corner highlight as well.When I got this I will admit I was a little hesitant because it was a cream highlight, but i had time to play around with it and out of everything I LOVE the blush and the contour the most. The highlighters are good especially for special occasions but the blush is so beautiful on the skin and looks very dewy. This pallet is functional for everyday makeup which I like and most of the colors are build-able. I received this product free for review purposesI love this product so much! first off the packaging is beautiful! it closes with a magnet and comes with a huge mirror inside. All of the shades in this palette are so beautiful! they can be stacked or worn alone! 2 of the shades on the right are very glittery the other three don't have glitter. This palette is great for that glow from within look. it blends very easily, the formula is super creamy! a little bit goes a long way.Me gusta la variedad de tonos que incluyeron en esta palette de Iluminadores, el que sean en crema, hace que el acabado en tu piel sea mas "natural" a mi punto de vista, lo único que no me gusto fue el iluminador en tono gris(plateado) los demás están perfectos.Yo recibí este producto por parte de la pagina Influenster, pero mi opinion es honesta y sincera. #gotitfree #review #honestreviewI received this free from influenster to test out and i love it! i was actually really surprised at how much i liked it because i never use cream highlighters. But these are just so lightweight and bendable they dont feel heavy on the skin at all. The pigmentation is great, and i love the different shades. Aurora is definitely my favorite i to boost my radiant glow under foundation. The only downside is the fact that it does not sit on foundation well. It looks amazing underneath but on top it separates the foundation. If you gently dab it on the high points of your cheeks to highlight it doesn't separate just as long as you avoid using a blending motion.

The creaminess of this makeup makes it easy to layer on, and it doesn't feel heavy on my face. 
 I wore this make up on two days back to back, and despite having breakout prone skin, did not break out - which is a HUGE plus in my book. 
 Lightstruck also made my skin look fairly clear in photos - I was really happy with how this turned out. I am looking forward to another weekend out somewhere so that I can play with other looks.Honestly I haven't used cream highlighters before this one but I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, I think this palette is a little to light and sheer for my complexion but I must say Prism is definitely wearable and buildable it is the golden shade and catches the light beautifully I love it. Ray can be used as a brow bone and inner corner highlight as well.When I got this I will admit I was a little hesitant because it was a cream highlight, but i had time to play around with it and out of everything I LOVE the blush and the contour the most. The highlighters are good especially for special occasions but the blush is so beautiful on the skin and looks very dewy. This pallet is functional for everyday makeup which I like and most of the colors are build-able. I received this product free for review purposesI love this product so much! first off the packaging is beautiful! it closes with a magnet and comes with a huge mirror inside. All of the shades in this palette are so beautiful! they can be stacked or worn alone! 2 of the shades on the right are very glittery the other three don't have glitter. This palette is great for that glow from within look. it blends very easily, the formula is super creamy! a little bit goes a long way.Me gusta la variedad de tonos que incluyeron en esta palette de Iluminadores, el que sean en crema, hace que el acabado en tu piel sea mas "natural" a mi punto de vista, lo único que no me gusto fue el iluminador en tono gris(plateado) los demás están perfectos.Yo recibí este producto por parte de la pagina Influenster, pero mi opinion es honesta y sincera. #gotitfree #review #honestreviewI received this free from influenster to test out and i love it! i was actually really surprised at how much i liked it because i never use cream highlighters. But these are just so lightweight and bendable they dont feel heavy on the skin at all. The pigmentation is great, and i love the different shades. Aurora is definitely my favorite i to boost my radiant glow under foundation. The only downside is the fact that it does not sit on foundation well. It looks amazing underneath but on top it separates the foundation. If you gently dab it on the high points of your cheeks to highlight it doesn't separate just as long as you avoid using a blending motion. It also makes for a great base to a powder highlight for the ultimate glow.So I was sent this product for free by Influenster to review it. The packaging is stunning. The mirror inside is large and perfect for travel. It has a magnetic closure so it is good for traveling. The products insides are okay. They are cream highlights or eyeshadows. The pink, gold, and taupe shade are glory without shimmer or very little. The white shade has tiny blue glitters and the silver shade has chunky glitter, but it's not textured. Over all, if you build it up it's very beautiful and natural lookingFirst off, the packaging is gorgeous. I love the pinky blush shade in the palette. It is a warm pink with a gold reflect, it reminds me a lot of Nars orgasm. Now the gold and bronze highlights, while they are gorgeous and not chunky, they're too dark for my porcelain fair skin as highlights. However I've tried the bronze shade as like a glowy no makeup bronzer look and I enjoyed it! The biggest let down of this palette for me was that the two lighter shades are pretty unflattering. One is a chunky silver, and the other a chunky iridescent blue. You can see the glitter sitting on your face. The creams do blend out extremely easily with the fingers and once set will not move all day. So if you don't mind chunky highlights, or if you're a bit darker than me, this palette could become your new go to :) Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.I like how it sits on top of powder but it's hard to love with the application process. I've been using my fingers and I'm not a fan of it, if they had a brush or sponge made of it would help a lot. I love the glow I get from the highlights. I just glow! Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes.This product is an okay option for those looking for a creamy Highlighter. It is very VERY sheer and more on the glittery side. Now with the price taken into account, I'm not sure it is worth it... I'd recommend trying it in the store first. My more detailed review video is below.If you read the directions and do it right, it works wonderfully! I have combination skin and I love the smooth feel of it!despise the wide range of reviews I think this palette will be my go to highlighter for some time, I think it's quite easy and simple to use, especially since I've been preferring the wet version of highlighters recently. I use my beauty blender to blend and mix my own customized highlighting shade to achieve that natural dewy trendy look, and I love it. Also the packaging is just gorgeous as well, hard to keep my eyes off of it. 
 *I received this product complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.The texture of the product itself is creamy but by that being said it's really easy to build up the color whether you want a natural glow or a beaming highlight.

This Palette is a cream highlight Palette and with me having oily skin I was a little worried I wouldn't like it on my skin. I can't use it by itself but I DO however, use it as a base for my powder highlights to intensify them and I love it! Love the packaging as well.I am so happy of have received this complementary from Influenster for testing purposes, the colors are stunning and I am in love with this!I've been a fan of Laura Mercier cosmetics for years, and was super excited when I'd received this palette complimentary for review purposes. It is a cream palette so buildable coverage and definitely set it with setting powder before moving on. I've seen some bad reviews about it and let me remind any product junkie out there, Laura Mercier concept is having a flawless face by using her products to accentuate your natural beauty. These highlighting cream does just that. A very polish application when I pair it with my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and "baked" everything with her translucent powder. It will not give you the exaggerated highlighted look that is trending on social media.. it can if you build and set several layers.Received the Lightstruck prismatic glow palette complimentary for review purposes. I was surprised to find the pigmentation is sheer with these creams. It's different from most creams and liquid highlighters on the market today. The colors don't layer well with powder highlighters (I tried layering and ABH glow kit on top and it looked cakey and powdery) These are definitely more for a natural look and best used by themselves with little product underneath. I think i'll be using them as body highlighters, they look really pretty when fully blended out on the collarbones.I got to swatch this palette in-store today for the highlighter launch event. I was totally let down by this palette. I mean, really, is this REALLY a Laura Mercier product??! I was shocked! Let's just say that ANY, even Drugstore highlighter, whether balm, liquid, powder (doesn't matter), but drugstore ones beat this anyday! Wow, this is a horrible product n palette! :( Save ur money, Loves. I can't see using this product (any part of it) for anything! Ugh, sorry I'm usually the one that takes the time to write reviews that r positive but I wanted to warn anyone out there about just how much of a letdown this was. Still can't believe Laura Mercier put this out. :(((Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes. I absolutely love this palette! They are very easy to blend, super pigmented , and beginner friendly. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves highlighting.I actually really liked this product more than I anticipated! I thought at first that the glitter would be too chunky, and that the cream would overall be too thick and not blendable. I was so wrong! All of these shades are sheer and contribute to an all-over "glowing from within" look. I love how sheer they are- they give you a healthy flush that way.I love this product! It is great for highlighting newbies, as it provides very soft, easy to blend shimmer. However, it's easy to layer for a more dramatic night time look. A little goes a long way, so this palette will last a long time!The packaging alone is to die for! The colors aren't typically what i would reach for but once i switched them i loved all of them! they're supper blend able and creamy. You can layer them on to create a more intense hight light and the pigment is sheer. The shimmer is intense but the colors itself blend out very well.

 To start off, I'm quite familiar with LM and their products but sadly this does not match. The top right two shades are far too glittery (think little girl's makeup palette) and will not work as a highlight - maybe as a base for eyeshadow. While the formula is great, this type of product works best using the warmth of your fingertips and not a brush. For an overall dewy look, I use all shades except the two glittery ones as blush, bronzer and highlight over primed skin and then add my foundation on top. It gives a wonderful glow from within and dimension to the face.I am loving this palette! I was pleasantly surprised when I got it, as it's super easy to apply. At first, I was nervous, as I tend to stay away from highlighters (due to my semi-oily skin), but was happy to see that this didn't make me appear super shiny. Each color provides the perfect amount of glow and each shade is build-able. I'd say it lasted throughout the day, for the most part and I like that even though it's a cream-base, it's not greasy. It also looks super natural and has not made me breakout, which is always a plus...!

 Initially when I looked at the colors I didn't think this would be a cohesive palette. Thr formula is very sheer with the ability to build. For those looking to blind with their highlight, this would make a great base. It is quite creamy so for those with oily skin I'd suggest using a good mattifying primer unless you really life the dewy look. This is meant to be used with the fingers, in order to get the shimmer from the product. Usinga brush will make you look oily. All the colors are really gorgeous. I like it but I think the formula can be make or break for some people.First of all, I was shocked by the packaging. Although it looked nice in the pictures, IRL it's cheaply made. It's card board material, and for the price tag you're paying you kinda feel ripped off. 
 As for the actual product, well it's kinda hit or miss. Some of them are nice others are just specs of glitter. All in all, there's nothing really impressive about this palette.I received this product complimentary from Influenster and when I tried it I was honestly pleasantly surprised by how pretty and versatile this palette is. As someone with very oily skin I would not normally reach for a cream highlighting palette, but I decided to give it a try for a night out in the city and put it to the test. Aurora is a really beautiful blush shade and looked pretty built up with Ray as a highlight on top of my cheekbones. I wore Beam as an overall eyeshadow, and would definitely recommend a primer if you have oily eyelids because at the end of the night the product was barely there... but the metallic shine was incredible! My favorite shade is Ray, it is such pretty all over highlight and looks STUNNING as an inner corner highlight shade. The trick to making this palette last is setting your foundation with powder and using primer before you go in with this product. If you do these crucial steps before I think this palette is really pretty and perfect for someone who likes the convenience and ease of a versatile palette.I received this from influenster free for testing purposes, and I'm so glad I did! I have been having so much fun layering the different shades to see what look I can get! I have to say aurora is my favorite because it has the least sparkle and just looks like a glow from within!

Wow, this is a horrible product n palette! :( Save ur money, Loves. I can't see using this product (any part of it) for anything! Ugh, sorry I'm usually the one that takes the time to write reviews that r positive but I wanted to warn anyone out there about just how much of a letdown this was. Still can't believe Laura Mercier put this out. :(((Received the Lightstruck Prismatic Glow Palette complimentary for review purposes. I absolutely love this palette! They are very easy to blend, super pigmented , and beginner friendly. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves highlighting.I actually really liked this product more than I anticipated! I thought at first that the glitter would be too chunky, and that the cream would overall be too thick and not blendable. I was so wrong! All of these shades are sheer and contribute to an all-over "glowing from within" look. I love how sheer they are- they give you a healthy flush that way.I love this product. The different shades they provide in this pallet allow you to create a few different lookes (day and night). I found that this palette allowed my face to naturally glow. the texture of the product is what i loved most. soft, creamy, and very easy to apply.This palette was sent to me complementary by Influenster for review and testing purposes. This has beautiful packaging but I'm more likely going to use it as a display than actual makeup, because the product isn't that exciting. The glow is a little glittery and not that pigmented. I also didn't find it to be buildable at all but I suppose it would be good for a subtle glow if you're into that.
