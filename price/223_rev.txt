I was going to buy the mascara anyway, so this was a better deal for me. Maxilash is one of my favorite mascaras. It doesn't flake, it isn't too wet, and the brush size is perfect. It's fluffy so I don't have to worry about poking my eye like with some other mascaras. The primer wasn't bad. It smelled and felt nice, but I don't think I would repurchase.I love this and I think it's worth the price that you pay for it. The mascara is my favorite and I love that I get to try other products along with this purchase!I was quite disappointed after using my mascara because the formula was very dry and was actually flaking on my face as I was applying it to my eyelashes. I was in DC and checked out the Sephora there and seen they had this same mascara in stock and opened it up to see and the formula was not dry at all so I just got a dupe. The primer made my foundation literally roll on my face. I returned the set and was very disappointed as I was so excited to receive it in the mail and couldn't wait to use it.If you like millions of glitter specks on your face, well this is for you! I hated seeing all that glitter on my face, especially coming from Guerlain! Just no! The mascara is nice no complaints there, but that primer is a deal breaker. The primer is tiny, more like a mini sample, even with the mascara included, I feel they should give you just a bit more of the primer. Not worth the $32, I have paid decent amounts of money for other luxury items to test out that come in sizes of kits like this, and I feel I've always gotten a much better bang for my buck. I will be returning.This is an excellent little set. Meteorites primer feels so light on my skin. I have a ruddiness in my cheeks. Not rosacea. Meteorites definitely minimizes the redness while imparting a soft glow to my skin. Meteorites has a very light scent but I think it smells pretty. The mascara comes in an elegant looking tube, and it definitely gives my lashes volume and curl. Didn't have any clumping or flaking. Great way to try these products or could be given as a cute little gift.I was going to buy the mascara anyway, so this was a better deal for me. Maxilash is one of my favorite mascaras.
