Had break outs after the first night I used this cream. Thought that maybe it was just me, so let skin calm down and tried again... Unfortunately, got acne again. I'll have to return this cream.Received a sample of this product which I got about 3 uses out of and I am instantly hooked. The product left my skin super soft and refreshed upon wakening. I don't have wrinkles, mainly just fine lines under my eyes which I treat with another brand of eye cream. I would love to purchase this product as my night cream, definitely recommend.The best night cream I've ever used.I have an acne prone skin but the vendor suggested it saying it's the best out there. I do love the scent (though very heavy) and the texture is amazing - creamy and smooth. But anyone who has an allergic skin or tends to break out with scented and heavily unnatural cosmetics should avoid this. Id recommend it however to those who's skin is resistant, as the cream itself is not bad.Absolutely love love love!!! It worth every penny! I have combined skin and big pores. This moisturizer is the best one I ever used! Skin is glowing and so soft! My pores are a lot smaller! Definitely will buy another one!I finally found a holy grail moisturizer for my dry skin. My face feels refreshed and has a nice glow in the morning. Doesn't feel sticky. Absorbed well with my skin. Has a nice light floral scent. It's pricey but it works so well for me!Had break outs after the first night I used this cream. Thought that maybe it was just me, so let skin calm down and tried again...
