Discover the mystery, playfulness, and seduction of Atelier Cologne with this collection of six scents.

Clémentine California is a sunny composition built around Clementine from Californiafruity, green, and sweet.

 In Vanille Insensée, an electrical current runs through the subtle sweetness of vanilla, jasmine, and fresh lime to bond with rich oak moss, woods, and spicy coriander.

 Bergamote Soleil is effervescent and lively with a soft hint of floral in the background. This unisex fragrance offers a sunny composition built around the freshness of bergamot from Calabria.

 Orange Sanguine, a zesty and energizing burst of crushed ripe fruit, plays sweet blood orange juice against bitter orange peel and sensual notes of geranium.

 Mandarine Glaciale is a citrus, fresh fragrance with notes of mandarin from Calabria, ginger from China, and heart of vetiver from Haiti.

 Sud Magnolia is a floral and fresh fragrance with notes of magnolia from Louisiana, bitter orange from Seville, and atlas cedarwood from Morocco.
