I used to live in Japan so I bought a lot of SK-II because it was cheaper. Japanese women have the best skin on this planet and many of them use SK-II.
 I splurged once and bought their Ultimate Revival Cream. It's expensive and I'm torn about it because I really liked it. I liked the texture of the product and I like how hydrating and dewy it made my skin. With that said, you can also bulk up on the Facial Treatment Masks and it also does the trick. But yes, I really liked this cream and I will buy it again. I also protect my skin and wear sunscreen everyday.I am 39 and I try to take really good care of my skin. I thought that this would be juat the thing, but its is greasy, really greasy. It takes so long to absorb into the skin I can only use it as a night time cream.The one thing I will say is that my skin is much more hydrated and you do not need to use much.I find that I go back to my old (yes to carrots) for my under makeup moisturizer.When I bought this cream, I admit, I was a sucker for "the higher the price, the better the product". This is an amazing cream, very thick, very nourishing. My face has been so dry and tight from this harsh winter weather and this cream definitely helped relieve some of that dryness but it sits on top of my skin like a very greasy, heavy layer and it takes forever to absorb. I had to use oil absorbing sheets before I could do my makeup on top of it. I simply didn't have the time to wait for it to absorb then do my makeup routine. It is a very good night time cream and a little bit does go a long way. The packaging is beautiful but I think you really are paying a lot for the look and the brand name. I am still in my mid twenties so I did not see any anti-aging benefits on my skin.I was so excited when SK-II released this cream thinking that it would be the perfect accompaniment to my night time skin care routine in winter. The texture of this cream is incredibly rich and is best used when you scoop out a small pea sized quantity, warm it up between your hands and press it onto your face for a few seconds. The good, it does feel very good on your skin and relieves it of tight and dry patches in winter. The bad, because my skin is prone to breakouts with heavy oily products I had breakouts and milia after a few weeks. I gave it to my mother to use, she is in her early 60's, lives in a very dry climate and has sensitive combination skin like me but she found the consistency, wrinkle reduction and refining effects to be quite suitable for her. It also soothed her skin after all day out in the sun and the non-stop indoor air conditioning.At first, I was quite impressed with this cream, but then I realized that my skin was feeling tight and was a little greasy. I tend to need creams with more hydration in addition to oil-based ingredients. I thought this would be it, and for the price, it should have all of the above.I have been using this cream for almost three months and I am very pleased. I have sensitive skin and have tried many moisturizers including La Mer, Shiseido Future Solution, Cle de Peau, La Prarie. Only this cream agrees with my skin. I have not broken out and my eyes did not feel uncomfortable. I do use it with the facial treatment essence. It is an amazing product but you do have to use it with the facial treatment essence to get more benefits from it. I will order the LXP serum next and try it.I used to live in Japan so I bought a lot of SK-II because it was cheaper. Japanese women have the best skin on this planet and many of them use SK-II.
