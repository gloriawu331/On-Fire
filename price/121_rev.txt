I love this set! You get a good amount of edp in an atomized bottle, which to me makes it worth the extra cost compared to a rollerball. This is a great way to try a bunch of different scents without having to commit to a full sized bottle. 
 Yes it's a bit pricy but Aerin is a luxury brand. With that being said, a little bit goes a long way.I didn't purchase this set but I'm extremely irritated that while only 1 or 2 you can buy individually for $15 this set of 5 is $100. The cost to purchase all these individually if they all were available would be $75. So basically they're up charging you $25 simply because a few of these scents aren't already being sold individually for $15. This set should be $65-$75 dollars given the actual value of the product. Disgusted. 
 Gave only one star for the package deal, not for the fragrances themselves which smell quite lovely. Mediterranean Honeysuckle being my favorite. But you're better off waiting for these to be free samples.Not worth $100, will be returning. These smell extremely basic and the bottles are small.I love this set!
