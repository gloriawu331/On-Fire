i don't wear much eye makeup, so i was looking for a warm, easy, foolproof palette that could transition from day to night - and had to be travel friendly. this checked all the boxes! i have to admit that i have a huge soft spot for guerlain, so you could probably find a palette thats more wallet-friendly, but it is such a beautiful palette! the quality screams guerlain (impeccable) and the payoff is really great, especially for a couple swipes on the lid to go. i'm sad that this is limited edition. i might have to stock up :)
 i also wish that it didn't come with the applicators - it could have been smaller! but i guess they are useful in a pinch.I like subtle natural looks for my eyelids since I want to look professional for work not like I'm going out at night. The set I got is the more light colors and I am very happy! High quality packaging and the brushes are actually very good even for their small size. I recommend trying it for work or day-time looks.The colors are very pale and I have fair skin.They are not true to color.The only reason I am keeping them is because they do look good on me because they are pale and the glitter shadow for the smoky eye looks more matte when wearing.t I was really disappointed. I have not tried the other palette it looks darker than the one I just reviewedAre these palettes revolutionary in colour? Style? Packaging? No...we've seen these colour combos before, in several brands. However, the packaging is perfect in my opinion. It's not cheap, it's sleek and it's travel and vanity friendly.Is the Guerlain quality there? Yes. I am a collector and I use most of my collected make up. So when I saw these palettes I knew I had to have them.I found the quality nothing less than Guerlain's usual top notch, pigmented and useable colour schemes. The well executed packaging design is very Guerlain and compact. Not small tho, just travel friendly. You can create the desired eye looks described in the instructions that come w these compacted palettes.Same goes for any compacted eye palette: the brushes are useless, but in a pinch, any make up aficionado could force them to work.What attracted me to these palettes in the first place was that they are all usable colours. There isn't one palette that contains the strange "yellow or green" few of us can make work. There are matts and semi lustres, but no glitters or sparkles.Bought the 06 Bois des Indes. The colors aren't pigmented at ALL. Doesn't show up on my pale olive complexion. Doesn't worth the C$69. I'm glad I didn't bought two at the same time.The case is pretty and small so it's easy to travel with. Also it didn't broke after it fell on the floor.
