I have been using it daily for two weeks. No visible difference yet. But it does hurt, hurts A LOT! It is my daily torture session. 
 I get redness after using this. But after sleeping mask and a night of sleep, all redness is gone. So redness is not a concern. 
 Hoping to see result soon!I started using this laser about a week ago. It's VERY strong and it does feel like a rubber band snapping on my face, but I started seeing results during the first week. I am looking forward to seeing what happens by the 2nd week! Perhaps will write an updated review after the first month.I have been using it daily for two weeks. No visible difference yet.
