Just started using this product which came in a travel set. It's light, but moisturizing and illuminating. I have sensitive combination, aging skin and tend to break out. I have used La Mer for many years and wanted to try something new. So far I love this moisturizer and all the products in the set (which includes the cleansing balm, night cream, and mist). Also all the product smell wonderful and natural instead of perfumy like lots of other products. I am giving it 4 stars because I have not yet seen the long term effects.My favourite face cream so far! I have used la mer and had terrible allergy reaction. Then I used Omo cream which calms my skin, and reduce redness for almost 40-50% after use. I really see the difference after using thisLeave it to my skin to fall in love with such an expensive brand :/ At first the smell was overpowering but after seeing how illuminated my skin looked after just the first application, I was sold. I have even gotten to like the smell...I feel like I've been to the spa every time! Love this brand!This moisturizer is definitely for dry skin. Pretty rich but not too much. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the moisturizing effect is superficial. It won't remove your signs of dehydration, like some serums and creams do, but instead creates an illusion of hydrated skin, which disappears as soon as you wash your face. Plus this strong herbal smell that puts me off.I have dry/combination skin. I absolutely love this lotion. I also use with omorovicza queen of hungary mist. Expensive but well worth it! Purchasing my 3rd bottle.I have dry skin and usually wear creams. I still found this very moisturizing! If you have fairly dry skin like myself you may want to use somthing a little more rich come the winter months. Great lighter moisturizer!This moisturizer does exactly what it stated it hydrates and illuminates the face. Lovely.The Omorovicza product line is remarkable! (albeit a tough name to remember at first ;-) For years, I erroneously thought I had “acne” because I always had some kind of pimple on my face. But I was wrong, it wasn't acne, I was just one of many people whose skin hates Dimethicone & Silica. And with that discovery, I changed my skincare, I changed my face!
 Omorivicza products have NO Silicones (but I found Silica in a serum :-( The products are expensive. But they are also extremely effective. I can honestly say, the tiniest bit of product yields deep, visible & long-lasting results, and I never feel like I’m “skimping”. I enjoy the refined hi-end spa quality & clean “herbal” scent of this brand. (The ILLUMINATING MOISTURIZER should smell fresh, and by no means sour, i think previous reviewer may indeed have gotten a bad batch.) The fragrance can be overwhelming when I open my shipments, but I find it subtle while using the products, and it doesn’t linger. I particularly appreciate how SIMPLE & neat these products are to use – no exhaustive treatments, no water splashing around, nothing sticky on your face, hands or bathroom fixtures – everything is clean, QUICK & EASY, and fast absorbing. My at-home results with this line are on-par with, or better than, successful ‘other brand’ facials I’ve rcvd professionally.
 THE ILLUMINATING MOISURIZER is “medium” in consistency, between a lotion and a cream (not too thin, not too thick). I use a full pump, and initially thought it wasn’t enough … but just wait … press/massage it in, give it a minute … it melts into the skin, hydrating perfectly, relieving dry patches & flakes, smoothing out the complexion & blurring imperfections, while adding subtle brightness & radiance (but no sparkles!) … full effect is about an hour after application, and it lasts all day. This moisturizer works beautifully under my mineral powder makeup, and is essentially a hydrator + primer in one - NO Dimethicone!) … However … I don’t think I’d find this moisturizer quite as effective if my skin was damages or wasn’t already improved & prepped by the other products in this skincare line. For a nighttime treatment, or on super cold/dry days, I use the Renewing Night Cream instead.
 I highly recommend Omorovicza, especially for congested & blemish-prone skin. Using multiple products from this line is very synergistic and, together, they produce great results – deeply clean, soft, smooth, hydrated skin that looks ultra healthy. I’ve tried several products in this line, and find the essentials in the INTRO KIT to be the most effective & consistent for me (addtl fave performers are: Gentle Buffing Cleanser, Reviving Eye Cream, and Copper Peel).I have the Omorovicza foam cleanser and feel like I'm having a true spa experience every time I wash my face. This moisturizer, however, did not work for my skin at all. First, I don't know if I got a bad batch but it smelled like sour cream-not a pleasant smell. I've read other reviews across the internet that said it smells like lavender, but that was definitely not what mine smelled like. There was nothing spa-like about the smell of this product. Second, it is a very strange texture. Its not a cream, but liquidy. Once more, like sour cream - the liquidy whitish fluid that collects on top of the cream. It was difficult to spread across my face unlike the heavier creams on the market for dry skins. And lastly it was not moisturizing for dry skin. I have very sensitive skin- mainly normal with an oily t zone and dry patches on my chin mainly brought about by the weather. This product did not eliminate the dry patches on my chin at all and to add insult to injury broke me out. Really disappointed since the cleanser is so nice. The search for the perfect moisturizer continues.hydrating and illuminating for combination skin (slightly oily in summer, slightly dry in winter). my face actually feels balanced which is rare since most moisturizers seem to tip my skin one way or the other. would purchase again, but i take off one star for the price. it does what it says but spending the money hurts a bit.I actually have to disagree with the previous review. This product was recommended to me because I have particularly dry skin, but wanted something light enough to wear daily in a warm part of the country and it's been absolutely fantastic! I shudder to think how dry the other reviewer's skin must be if she's forced to use a heavy night cream to get any moisture during the day. I think the scent is particularly nice. It's not quite as lovely as Omorovicza's Intensive Hydra-Lifting Cream, but less obtrusive. I have seen a marked improvement in my skin since using it for about 3 months.This Illuminating Moisturizer has a decent hydrating effect, but unfortunately it simply is not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. For those with normal or combination skin, I believe this would work very well, but those with dry skin will find their skin not quite hydrated enough throughout the day. Interestingly, I find that Omorovicza's Rejuvenating Night Cream proved to be a worthy hydrator during the day for me.
 The illuminating claim of this product seems true -- though not glittery thank goodness, it does seem to impart a certain glow-y effect to the skin that is not extravagant or too noticeable.
 One downside to this product is the scent, which isn't necessarily unpleasant, but I personally disliked it -- it's rather like a very mineral-y smell that's a bit difficult to explain. If you're sensitive to scents, you may wish to skip this particular moisturizer.Just started using this product which came in a travel set. It's light, but moisturizing and illuminating.

I enjoy the refined hi-end spa quality & clean “herbal” scent of this brand. (The ILLUMINATING MOISTURIZER should smell fresh, and by no means sour, i think previous reviewer may indeed have gotten a bad batch.) The fragrance can be overwhelming when I open my shipments, but I find it subtle while using the products, and it doesn’t linger. I particularly appreciate how SIMPLE & neat these products are to use – no exhaustive treatments, no water splashing around, nothing sticky on your face, hands or bathroom fixtures – everything is clean, QUICK & EASY, and fast absorbing. My at-home results with this line are on-par with, or better than, successful ‘other brand’ facials I’ve rcvd professionally.
 THE ILLUMINATING MOISURIZER is “medium” in consistency, between a lotion and a cream (not too thin, not too thick). I use a full pump, and initially thought it wasn’t enough … but just wait … press/massage it in, give it a minute … it melts into the skin, hydrating perfectly, relieving dry patches & flakes, smoothing out the complexion & blurring imperfections, while adding subtle brightness & radiance (but no sparkles!) … full effect is about an hour after application, and it lasts all day. This moisturizer works beautifully under my mineral powder makeup, and is essentially a hydrator + primer in one - NO Dimethicone!) … However … I don’t think I’d find this moisturizer quite as effective if my skin was damages or wasn’t already improved & prepped by the other products in this skincare line. For a nighttime treatment, or on super cold/dry days, I use the Renewing Night Cream instead.
 I highly recommend Omorovicza, especially for congested & blemish-prone skin. Using multiple products from this line is very synergistic and, together, they produce great results – deeply clean, soft, smooth, hydrated skin that looks ultra healthy. I’ve tried several products in this line, and find the essentials in the INTRO KIT to be the most effective & consistent for me (addtl fave performers are: Gentle Buffing Cleanser, Reviving Eye Cream, and Copper Peel).I have the Omorovicza foam cleanser and feel like I'm having a true spa experience every time I wash my face. This moisturizer, however, did not work for my skin at all. First, I don't know if I got a bad batch but it smelled like sour cream-not a pleasant smell. I've read other reviews across the internet that said it smells like lavender, but that was definitely not what mine smelled like. There was nothing spa-like about the smell of this product. Second, it is a very strange texture. Its not a cream, but liquidy. Once more, like sour cream - the liquidy whitish fluid that collects on top of the cream. It was difficult to spread across my face unlike the heavier creams on the market for dry skins. And lastly it was not moisturizing for dry skin. I have very sensitive skin- mainly normal with an oily t zone and dry patches on my chin mainly brought about by the weather.

This product was recommended to me because I have particularly dry skin, but wanted something light enough to wear daily in a warm part of the country and it's been absolutely fantastic! I shudder to think how dry the other reviewer's skin must be if she's forced to use a heavy night cream to get any moisture during the day. I think the scent is particularly nice. It's not quite as lovely as Omorovicza's Intensive Hydra-Lifting Cream, but less obtrusive.

Purchasing my 3rd bottle.I have dry skin and usually wear creams. I still found this very moisturizing! If you have fairly dry skin like myself you may want to use somthing a little more rich come the winter months. Great lighter moisturizer!This moisturizer does exactly what it stated it hydrates and illuminates the face. Lovely.The Omorovicza product line is remarkable! (albeit a tough name to remember at first ;-) For years, I erroneously thought I had “acne” because I always had some kind of pimple on my face. But I was wrong, it wasn't acne, I was just one of many people whose skin hates Dimethicone & Silica. And with that discovery, I changed my skincare, I changed my face!

For those with normal or combination skin, I believe this would work very well, but those with dry skin will find their skin not quite hydrated enough throughout the day. Interestingly, I find that Omorovicza's Rejuvenating Night Cream proved to be a worthy hydrator during the day for me.
 The illuminating claim of this product seems true -- though not glittery thank goodness, it does seem to impart a certain glow-y effect to the skin that is not extravagant or too noticeable.
 One downside to this product is the scent, which isn't necessarily unpleasant, but I personally disliked it -- it's rather like a very mineral-y smell that's a bit difficult to explain. If you're sensitive to scents, you may wish to skip this particular moisturizer.Just started using this product which came in a travel set. It's light, but moisturizing and illuminating.

Using multiple products from this line is very synergistic and, together, they produce great results – deeply clean, soft, smooth, hydrated skin that looks ultra healthy. I’ve tried several products in this line, and find the essentials in the INTRO KIT to be the most effective & consistent for me (addtl fave performers are: Gentle Buffing Cleanser, Reviving Eye Cream, and Copper Peel).I have the Omorovicza foam cleanser and feel like I'm having a true spa experience every time I wash my face. This moisturizer, however, did not work for my skin at all. First, I don't know if I got a bad batch but it smelled like sour cream-not a pleasant smell. I've read other reviews across the internet that said it smells like lavender, but that was definitely not what mine smelled like. There was nothing spa-like about the smell of this product. Second, it is a very strange texture. Its not a cream, but liquidy. Once more, like sour cream - the liquidy whitish fluid that collects on top of the cream. It was difficult to spread across my face unlike the heavier creams on the market for dry skins. And lastly it was not moisturizing for dry skin. I have very sensitive skin- mainly normal with an oily t zone and dry patches on my chin mainly brought about by the weather. This product did not eliminate the dry patches on my chin at all and to add insult to injury broke me out. Really disappointed since the cleanser is so nice. The search for the perfect moisturizer continues.hydrating and illuminating for combination skin (slightly oily in summer, slightly dry in winter). my face actually feels balanced which is rare since most moisturizers seem to tip my skin one way or the other. would purchase again, but i take off one star for the price. it does what it says but spending the money hurts a bit.Just started using this product which came in a travel set. It's light, but moisturizing and illuminating. I have sensitive combination, aging skin and tend to break out. I have used La Mer for many years and wanted to try something new. So far I love this moisturizer and all the products in the set (which includes the cleansing balm, night cream, and mist). Also all the product smell wonderful and natural instead of perfumy like lots of other products. I am giving it 4 stars because I have not yet seen the long term effects.My favourite face cream so far! I have used la mer and had terrible allergy reaction. Then I used Omo cream which calms my skin, and reduce redness for almost 40-50% after use. I really see the difference after using thisLeave it to my skin to fall in love with such an expensive brand :/ At first the smell was overpowering but after seeing how illuminated my skin looked after just the first application, I was sold. I have even gotten to like the smell...I feel like I've been to the spa every time! Love this brand!This moisturizer is definitely for dry skin. Pretty rich but not too much. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the moisturizing effect is superficial. It won't remove your signs of dehydration, like some serums and creams do, but instead creates an illusion of hydrated skin, which disappears as soon as you wash your face. Plus this strong herbal smell that puts me off.I have dry/combination skin. I absolutely love this lotion. I also use with omorovicza queen of hungary mist. Expensive but well worth it! Purchasing my 3rd bottle.I have dry skin and usually wear creams. I still found this very moisturizing! If you have fairly dry skin like myself you may want to use somthing a little more rich come the winter months. Great lighter moisturizer!This moisturizer does exactly what it stated it hydrates and illuminates the face. Lovely.The Omorovicza product line is remarkable! (albeit a tough name to remember at first ;-) For years, I erroneously thought I had “acne” because I always had some kind of pimple on my face. But I was wrong, it wasn't acne, I was just one of many people whose skin hates Dimethicone & Silica. And with that discovery, I changed my skincare, I changed my face!
 Omorivicza products have NO Silicones (but I found Silica in a serum :-( The products are expensive. But they are also extremely effective. I can honestly say, the tiniest bit of product yields deep, visible & long-lasting results, and I never feel like I’m “skimping”. I enjoy the refined hi-end spa quality & clean “herbal” scent of this brand. (The ILLUMINATING MOISTURIZER should smell fresh, and by no means sour, i think previous reviewer may indeed have gotten a bad batch.) The fragrance can be overwhelming when I open my shipments, but I find it subtle while using the products, and it doesn’t linger. I particularly appreciate how SIMPLE & neat these products are to use – no exhaustive treatments, no water splashing around, nothing sticky on your face, hands or bathroom fixtures – everything is clean, QUICK & EASY, and fast absorbing. My at-home results with this line are on-par with, or better than, successful ‘other brand’ facials I’ve rcvd professionally.
 THE ILLUMINATING MOISURIZER is “medium” in consistency, between a lotion and a cream (not too thin, not too thick). I use a full pump, and initially thought it wasn’t enough … but just wait … press/massage it in, give it a minute … it melts into the skin, hydrating perfectly, relieving dry patches & flakes, smoothing out the complexion & blurring imperfections, while adding subtle brightness & radiance (but no sparkles!) … full effect is about an hour after application, and it lasts all day. This moisturizer works beautifully under my mineral powder makeup, and is essentially a hydrator + primer in one - NO Dimethicone!) … However … I don’t think I’d find this moisturizer quite as effective if my skin was damages or wasn’t already improved & prepped by the other products in this skincare line. For a nighttime treatment, or on super cold/dry days, I use the Renewing Night Cream instead.

This product was recommended to me because I have particularly dry skin, but wanted something light enough to wear daily in a warm part of the country and it's been absolutely fantastic!

For those with normal or combination skin, I believe this would work very well, but those with dry skin will find their skin not quite hydrated enough throughout the day. Interestingly, I find that Omorovicza's Rejuvenating Night Cream proved to be a worthy hydrator during the day for me.
 The illuminating claim of this product seems true -- though not glittery thank goodness, it does seem to impart a certain glow-y effect to the skin that is not extravagant or too noticeable.
 One downside to this product is the scent, which isn't necessarily unpleasant, but I personally disliked it -- it's rather like a very mineral-y smell that's a bit difficult to explain. If you're sensitive to scents, you may wish to skip this particular moisturizer.
