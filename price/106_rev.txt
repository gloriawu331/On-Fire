This shampoo and conditioner is amazing! Makes my hair so soft, manageable, light and clean. It has a light coconut scent but not overpowering. Worth the price in my opinion. I've tried ouai and Amika products and it doesn't even compare to this stuff.This shampoo and conditioner is amazing! Makes my hair so soft, manageable, light and clean.
