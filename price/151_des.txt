 For a deeply cleansed, refined, and revived look and feel, the Omorovicza Moor Mud Set meets all your skin care needs. The Thermal Cleansing Balm removes all makeupeven waterproof mascaraas it purifies and moisturizes the skin. It contains calcium and magnesium-rich Hungarian moor mud to revive the skin and lift away toxins, while orange blossom oil leaves the face with a deliciously light scent. The Deep Cleansing Mask is a calcium and magnesium-rich treatment, made with a combination of Hungarian moor mud and French clay to draw out all pore-clogging oils and impurities without stripping or pulling the skin for a glowy appearance. The Refining Facial Polisher restores dull, tired skin to its former radiance through a combination of mechanical and chemical exfoliation, designed to smooth, brighten, combat UV damage, and diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, thanks to elegant tropical fruit extracts and lava powder. The Egyptian cotton mini cleansing mitt is machine washable and works to thoroughly cleanse and support the skin’s natural microcirculation process.
