This product removed all build up! Gave back my curls that bounce. Will continue using it.Works wonders, I've been using so much oils in my hair and I felt as if it was being weighed down. I tried the buildup buster and it actually cleaned my hair away off all the products and oils but still left it moisturized . No frizz hereI've read so many reviews on so many products and about how they "saved my hair". Well, none of those products have ever saved my hair. This though... I have no words. I had given up all hope for this curly, frizzy mop of mine. This product worked all the miracles it was supposed to and then some! I have invested a lot of money into my hair but this product is something that I absolutely will never live without for the rest of my life! Please, for the love of curls, buy this product!I really wanted to love this as I'm a Deva Curl fanatic but as someone with beyond think 3c /4a hair this really want enough for me. I'll admit my curls did look good after using this but this did nothing to help cleanse and clarify my scalp which was the whole reason I bought it.loved this product. I may have used more than I needed (my hair was dirty) but I was super impressed by the end results. My color seemed brighter and my hair felt amazing and had TONS of volume.This product is great. Like most people with curly hair, I use a lot of product for styling and there was always buildup left on my scalp, even after using DevaCurl's NoPoo. This got rid of all the buildup - it was actually really impressive. I don't think my hair was bouncier or shinier as the product description says it should be, but it definitely gets an A++ on removing buildup. It smells great too. Great for a once a week use, but I think it's best followed up by a deep conditioner as it initially made my hair feel a little dry.Bounced my curls right back to life! Definitely not something to use daily but as a weekly application.This product removed all build up! Gave back my curls that bounce. Will continue using it.This product removed all build up!
