I really only use one of the colors in this palette but use it everyday! I never liked using liquid concealer because it looked cakey and would fade by the end of the day. When I found this I was so impressed by how well it works. I use it over all the red areas on my face and it COMPLETELY covers them. I would recommend this.It does work great. First introduced after getting fillers . I'm 56 and must be careful in using powder concealers under eyes. If I'm having a bad morning and under eyes show it this had to be applied with lots of eye cream under neath but Brian spots wrinkles between eyebrows around mouth works great!!! Under eyes be careful . If no wrinkles and just dark circles this is the holy grail !I have dark spots from old pimples (thanks to hyperpigmintation!!) and melasma (thanks to babies!!) I've struggled to find a concealer that doesn't cause breakouts, that has great coverage, different shades to accommodate various skin ailments. It is one of those products that I cannot live without. It makes me look amazing with all my spots neatly hidden away!I am so glad I bought this on a whim! I have hereditary circles that have never been so flatteringly concealed. This palette goes above and beyond.I've been using this corrector for about 10 years. It is hands down (and I've been on the look out for new product continually) the best thing I've ever used for concealing whatever it is that needs to be concealed. I've been trying all sorts of the pencil correctors that are out there and most do not have the staying power this compact has. Also, you can mix and match to the current color of your skin (as we know it can change). It works with every skin tone up to darker tones (there is a different palette with other colors for you fab ladies). Is it more expensive than some? yep but it lasts forever. Try it and you'll be hooked.I've used this palette for two years (got it at the derm doc's office). It has SPF, and the shades do exactly what it says they will. They ARE powders so be sure your face is moisturized. From acne to Rosacea, this covers all of it. A little pricey, but one palette has lasted me beyond a year. Wish they made the colors separately. My shade 2 is all used up. So happy Sephora carries it now!I really only use one of the colors in this palette but use it everyday!
