This is the only oil I need! I wear under makeup, I wear it alone, I wear it at night, all the time! When I run out, my skin returns to patchy dry areas, oily t-zone, dark patches around mouth and dull dull dull. After about five to seven days of this stuff I get my even surface glow back! It goes on oily, let it sit a few mins before putting anything on top. I swear, I feel confident enough to do out in public without bb cream after I have treated my skin several days! I should say I ise Omorovicza's thermal cleansing balm and a washcloth every morning as well. And their foaming cleanser with a washcloth at night. This entire line is expensive but I save so much time with less makeup application and feel better with the face I present!I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone. It gave me healthy, clear, glowing skin instantly. I mixed it with my moisturizer but definitely can use it alone. It absorbs in my skin so quickly and didn't feel greasy (I was nervous since it is an oil). The best is the smell, very pampering.I really love this oil! I have purchased Nude, Josie Maran, in the past and most recently after this, Tatcha. This oil ranks #1 in a tie w Nude for me because it is highly moisturizing without being greasy, leaves skin baby soft and is beautiful under makeup! I get a ton of compliments when I put this on in the morning before makeup. And major plus- smells amazing, like mimosa flower!One of the worst oils I have tried and I had such high hopes for it, especially considering it's really , really high price. I mean, it is soooo overpriced. It doesn't moisturize the skin what-so-ever. It is heavily scented. The face feels dry. It just sits on top of the skin...so disappointed with this product. Shame on you Omorovicza for charging so much for a bad product.Nothing special given the price. Once again Sephora has not included the full list of ingredients. It's a long one. At the top is almond oil. The "actives" are down near the bottom. There are about 20 ingredients in this oil which also includes linalool, cinamyl alcohol and fragrance. This is actually a heavily fragranced product. I believe it is supposed to be mimosa.The vitamin & the -rich sea buckthorn berry oil is rejuvenate to the skin + firm the skin and got more soft, moisture as of the almond in it .i like it !!!!! i waiting for the of the body oil protract from Omorovicza to bring to seforaThis is the only oil I need!
