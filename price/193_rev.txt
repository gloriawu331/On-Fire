I've been religiously using Dr Lancer products for 5 years. Nothing compares! Pricey, but worth every penny.While I like the Lancer Method Polish, I found this "intensive" night cream to be anything but. It is lightweight, not rich as advertised, and I did not see any appreciable results after using for a month. A big waste of money.I have been using the Dr Lancer Method for a year and now I wanted to try his Night cream, and now I am addicted to it, even my Mom loved it. you should try it , it leaves the skin very hydrated . now even my makeup looks better, and I am getting so many compliments about my skin. Dr Lancer is a genius .I use this product year round - it is amazing!I love the amount of moisture that this cream provides for my dry skin. I use this product when the weather outside is harsh and my skin craves moisture. It leaves me with a velvet touch and smooth finish, absolutely love it!I've been religiously using Dr Lancer products for 5 years. Nothing compares!
