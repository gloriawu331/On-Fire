I left this on the AoS website as a review, but I'm leaving it here as well because this is where I'd originally seen the brush, as well as good reviews for it, but every review on the AoS website is negative and with good reason!
 I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, who had been using an inexpensive boar's hair brush that he had purchased in Germany for the last three years until he cracked the (plastic) handle of it. He was thrilled to receive this as a gift just two days ago, but while shaving before work today - two days after taking it out of the box for the very first time - the brush portion fell right out of the handle while he was in the middle of shaving. Absolutely unbelievable. As I had an early start on my shopping this year and it's beyond the AoS limited return policy, I can't even send it back! I had assumed that a brand like AoS, with a price tag to match, would have made a quality product, but after reading these reviews it looks like this 'Fusion' brush was always a dismal piece of cheap garbage.This is a useful product for shaving.I left this on the AoS website as a review, but I'm leaving it here as well because this is where I'd originally seen the brush, as well as good reviews for it, but every review on the AoS website is negative and with good reason!
