I bought the Philtre Ceylon cologne over the weekend and have worn it twice. This is definitely going back. On the tester strips, it is a light scent that smells most strongly of tea. On me, it's heavy, lasts forever (which is generally a good thing, but not if you don't like it!), and it's not as much tea as it is something else that I can't identify. I definitely recommend spraying some on yourself and giving it some time for this one. Also, as a female who generally likes wearing scents meant for men, this one is too masculine to get away with.I bought the Philtre Ceylon cologne over the weekend and have worn it twice.
