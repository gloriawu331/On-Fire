This product is a bit expensive but is worth every penny. I love the finish, it leaves my skin fresh, even toned and flawless. I'm about to finish my first tube and I will definitely rebuy this product.Yes, the price point is a little nuts and the rose smell is annoying. But I am nearing 40, and my dry, sensitive skin has some "special needs" at this time. This foundation checked all my boxes! It blends easily, stays smooth all day, provides nice coverage without looking heavy or mask-like, moisturizes, doesn't settle into my lines, and doesn't cling to dry spots. My skin has yellow/olive undertones, so the yellow tint of this foundation works for me. However, if you have pinkish skin, I'm not sure if it would look so hot.Absolutely not worth the money. There's nothing bad about this product. It blends well. The light color worked really well tonight. There's just nothing about it to justify the price compared to other bb creamsAgree with the last reviewer- I could not get past the fragrance. It seemed like the coverage was like a tinted moisturizer. It blended in well. Also wish that there were more colors- the light was the best choice but not ideal.I liked the texture and feel of this BB serum. However, the fragrance was bothersome and it just did not provide the coverage I needed. I have a medium skin tone with slight yellow undertones and the Light shade worked well for me. I haven't noticed a 'plumping' effect and found that I did need a moisturizer with this product. The fragrance and/or sunscreen ingredients were the deal breakers for me. We really don't need fragrance in skincare!!Best BB cream I've ever used . Leaves my face flawless and smooth . It feels like I'm not wearing any makeup . Definitely worth the splurge !I have been searching for quite sometime for something to even my skintone without the heavy makeup look or worse, the dirty face look. The majority of BB cremes fall into the dirty face look.I bought the lighter shade, was nervous during the first application. The color seemed to be a faint yellow base, which literally blended into my skin tone perfectly. Did not feel greasy, gave a soft glow that was not a greasy glow. The ultimate test: I looked at the result in natural light and it was a perfect match.My search for the HG base is over. Expensive it is BUT I justify it by convincing myself since I am frugal with many things and I save soooo much from being a non smoker and drinker, $75 per year is nothing. Smokers pay way more than that per month. I only need a wee bit so I know it will last about a year.When I first bought this, I thought, I can't believe I just spent $75 on a bb cream when I already have three in my drawer. I used it for the first time this morning. At first, I didn't notice much difference, but within a few minutes, my skin was looking plumped up (especially my smile lines) and my pores minimized. It also corrected some of my redness. I applied a light dusting of my Guerlain Meteorites over it as a finishing powder and my skin looks perfect. You cannot tell that I have makeup on in any light. It truly looks like my skin. I would purchase this product again. It made my skin look absolutely perfect.This product is a bit expensive but is worth every penny.
