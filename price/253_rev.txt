I used the product per the directions, applying all over concentrating at the roots, then I just did my regular blowout routine. I noticed a moderate amount of volume when I had finished drying my hair, but about five hours later my hair was laying flat against my head. I did not use hairspray, which may have affected the longevity. I would try their volume mist instead, since that seems to be getting better reviews.I used the product per the directions, applying all over concentrating at the roots, then I just did my regular blowout routine.
