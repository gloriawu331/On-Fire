I have been using this product for a year now and it has worked great so far. I see thinning in the hair and my bikini area is pretty much gone. You need to keep up with routine as described in directions or you will see little to no results.I've been using this since end of November It's now January 12th so I'm in the process of my 4th treatment. I've been using every 2 weeks as directed and it does work! Hair is gone in some spots and much much thinner in other spots. You need to have patience and follow directions. You need to read all paperwork. So the pain is definitely uncomfortable the 1st 2 times but as your hair thins out it gets much easier. I can do a level 4 now on every area except the bikini area which I'm still doing level 3. Also be sure to do as many pulses as they recommend - that is important to cover all areas.After using for 3 months I think I can give it an honest review. I definitely see a major difference in my hair growth. I have used it consistently every two weeks. While all my hair is not gone, a lot of the follicles are gone and the remaining are thinner and have slower regrowth. I am a wuss with pain and can only handle level 2, even with lidocaine cream, but I think it is definitely worth the money and will continue to use it until all hair is gone. This is painful depending on the area of use but you can work up to the higher levels.So I've been using this for over a year now. Works great. Some areas are going to be more sensitive than others so you may need to use it at level 1 or 2 to start. My bikini area hair is gone completely. You need patience but it works!!!!!I've only used this twice so far, so I cannot comment on results just yet, but I thought I would give some feedback regarding the feeling the laser has on the skin. Upon 1st use, I was VERY hesitant about what to expect with my new Tria. I only plan to treat certain areas on my face, so I went ahead and started off on the lowest setting and literally laughed, as I felt absolutely nothing. I moved it up to setting 2, and again, I laughed. I jumped up to setting 4, and only got the slightest little warming zap sensation. Then I moved it up to full blast (5) and found it totally fine, but with slightly more warming and a little brief stinging sensation that went away in a second. My attitude went from being totally apprehensive, to zapping at level 5 in a matter of minutes. I will say that I typically wax every week, so I am used to this sort of thing on my face. If you are a waxer, this should be no trouble for you! I am looking forward to seeing results soon!I received this as a gift & I'm beyond happy with the results. I honestly am still in the beginners stage of the process (working your way up to level 5 takes A LOT of determination & guts!) but so far at just a level 3 I'm already seeing results. A definite MUST HAVE!This product was much needed! Nervous to spend this much on a product but I am beyond happy with the results! It can be slightly painful at the beginning but once you get used to it, if you follow the directions, you can be hair free before you know it! I am so thankful for this product!!I've seen a lot of conflicting reviews about this product, but for me, it's one of the best purchases I've ever made--not just cosmetic, but in any category. I think the issue is: this isn't really for just normal-grade hair removal. If you have a normative amount and color of female hair, it may not do much of anything. If you have serious idiopathic hirsutism, though, this is a truly incredible product for a super-difficult problem. It's not truly and utterly permanent, but that's kind of the point of owning the laser instead of going back endlessly to a med spa. After having the Tria for a year, I feel confident going outside on a daily basis, and I no longer have to go through the cycle of letting my jet-black chin hair grow to highly visible lengths so it can be waxed. Be aware: it's probably not effective lower than setting 5 (I think the other settings are really just there to train users), and setting 5 is, to be blunt, painful. And if you jerk your hand away, it doesn't work. Using the device takes practice and quite a lot of nerve. It also takes a really, really long time on large areas--legs realistically take an entire afternoon, including all the recharging that's needed to do two legs on Setting 5.I have been using this product for a year now and it has worked great so far.

I only plan to treat certain areas on my face, so I went ahead and started off on the lowest setting and literally laughed, as I felt absolutely nothing. I moved it up to setting 2, and again, I laughed. I jumped up to setting 4, and only got the slightest little warming zap sensation. Then I moved it up to full blast (5) and found it totally fine, but with slightly more warming and a little brief stinging sensation that went away in a second. My attitude went from being totally apprehensive, to zapping at level 5 in a matter of minutes. I will say that I typically wax every week, so I am used to this sort of thing on my face. If you are a waxer, this should be no trouble for you! I am looking forward to seeing results soon!I received this as a gift & I'm beyond happy with the results. I honestly am still in the beginners stage of the process (working your way up to level 5 takes A LOT of determination & guts!) but so far at just a level 3 I'm already seeing results. A definite MUST HAVE!This product was much needed! Nervous to spend this much on a product but I am beyond happy with the results! It can be slightly painful at the beginning but once you get used to it, if you follow the directions, you can be hair free before you know it! I am so thankful for this product!!I have been using this product for a year now and it has worked great so far. I see thinning in the hair and my bikini area is pretty much gone. You need to keep up with routine as described in directions or you will see little to no results.I've been using this since end of November It's now January 12th so I'm in the process of my 4th treatment. I've been using every 2 weeks as directed and it does work! Hair is gone in some spots and much much thinner in other spots. You need to have patience and follow directions. You need to read all paperwork. So the pain is definitely uncomfortable the 1st 2 times but as your hair thins out it gets much easier. I can do a level 4 now on every area except the bikini area which I'm still doing level 3. Also be sure to do as many pulses as they recommend - that is important to cover all areas.After using for 3 months I think I can give it an honest review. I definitely see a major difference in my hair growth. I have used it consistently every two weeks. While all my hair is not gone, a lot of the follicles are gone and the remaining are thinner and have slower regrowth. I am a wuss with pain and can only handle level 2, even with lidocaine cream, but I think it is definitely worth the money and will continue to use it until all hair is gone. This is painful depending on the area of use but you can work up to the higher levels.So I've been using this for over a year now. Works great. Some areas are going to be more sensitive than others so you may need to use it at level 1 or 2 to start. My bikini area hair is gone completely.

It can be slightly painful at the beginning but once you get used to it, if you follow the directions, you can be hair free before you know it! I am so thankful for this product!!I've seen a lot of conflicting reviews about this product, but for me, it's one of the best purchases I've ever made--not just cosmetic, but in any category. I think the issue is: this isn't really for just normal-grade hair removal. If you have a normative amount and color of female hair, it may not do much of anything. If you have serious idiopathic hirsutism, though, this is a truly incredible product for a super-difficult problem. It's not truly and utterly permanent, but that's kind of the point of owning the laser instead of going back endlessly to a med spa. After having the Tria for a year, I feel confident going outside on a daily basis, and I no longer have to go through the cycle of letting my jet-black chin hair grow to highly visible lengths so it can be waxed. Be aware: it's probably not effective lower than setting 5 (I think the other settings are really just there to train users), and setting 5 is, to be blunt, painful. And if you jerk your hand away, it doesn't work. Using the device takes practice and quite a lot of nerve. It also takes a really, really long time on large areas--legs realistically take an entire afternoon, including all the recharging that's needed to do two legs on Setting 5.
