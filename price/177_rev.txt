I use this brush to apply my under eye concealer and I've no complaints. It's soft, and functional for detailed work. I do however have to blend and blur the edges with another brush.

This is my second Surratt brush, and I dare say it won't be my last.I use this brush to apply my under eye concealer and I've no complaints. It's soft, and functional for detailed work.
