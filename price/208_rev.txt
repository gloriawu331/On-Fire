Wow!! This mask is seriously magical! I can't even explain it. The results are instant, real, and so different from other masks. The nourishment, hydration, radiance, and how it almost plumps the skin. Just fabulous! And when you break it down, you're getting 6 masks - that's $17.50 a mask, which is comparable to other high end sheet masks. It's just that most sell boxes of 4 and not 6. I'm really impressed with the results! Love! One of my new favorites!Good.. but there are better ones for the priceThere is no getting around this mask is expensive. It. is. so. pricey! 
 But...I can undoubtedly say this mask is effective and does what it says. It's not a face lift and you won't see insane changes to your skin, but you will see smaller pores, more hydrated skin, glowing skin, and plump skin. 
 If this were half the price I would use it more frequently. They suggest twice per week but I am using it now only after chemical peels.I love this mask, it truly looks like new skin, I use it twice a week.

I expected to come out if with either a nose job or lips like a Kardashian. Neither happened. I came out with smooth skin and the consistency was nice and refreshing, but at the same time it didn't fix my double chin, unibrow, or cleft lip. So I think I'll stick to my $20 face masks that do the same thing so I can spend my money to actually look better instead of covering up.The gel-like consistency of the mask helps this mask stay in place so you can function without worry that it may slip off. There's so much product on it too that there's excess you'll have to massage into your skin afterward. This really helps tired skin look rejuvenated and more plump. I have sensitive skin but found that I didn't have a reaction to any of the ingredients, which was fantastic. I followed the mask up with a hydrating moisturizer and the next day my skin still felt supple.This is amazing stays on face so you can go about your business. The results are great rehydrated, firmer smoother looking skin. Great for that special day or pick me upI love these masks! I'm a red head with very pale skin living in Texas so I am very careful what I use. The mask is a little tricky to place the first time but the amount of moisturizer that you get is incredible.

The results are instant, real, and so different from other masks. The nourishment, hydration, radiance, and how it almost plumps the skin. Just fabulous! And when you break it down, you're getting 6 masks - that's $17.50 a mask, which is comparable to other high end sheet masks. It's just that most sell boxes of 4 and not 6. I'm really impressed with the results! Love! One of my new favorites!Good.. but there are better ones for the priceThere is no getting around this mask is expensive. It. is. so. pricey! 
 But...I can undoubtedly say this mask is effective and does what it says. It's not a face lift and you won't see insane changes to your skin, but you will see smaller pores, more hydrated skin, glowing skin, and plump skin. 
 If this were half the price I would use it more frequently. They suggest twice per week but I am using it now only after chemical peels.I love this mask, it truly looks like new skin, I use it twice a week. I typically put it on right before bed and then rub the remaining serum into my face. The next morning my face glows and my make-up looks awresom! This is worth every penny.Just went to sephora in guilford in surrey bc and they had a bunch of them for sale so i dont know whey they would advertise online only when u could just call your local sephora and they probably will have itSo I purchased this for $100. I expected to come out if with either a nose job or lips like a Kardashian. Neither happened. I came out with smooth skin and the consistency was nice and refreshing, but at the same time it didn't fix my double chin, unibrow, or cleft lip. So I think I'll stick to my $20 face masks that do the same thing so I can spend my money to actually look better instead of covering up.The gel-like consistency of the mask helps this mask stay in place so you can function without worry that it may slip off. There's so much product on it too that there's excess you'll have to massage into your skin afterward. This really helps tired skin look rejuvenated and more plump. I have sensitive skin but found that I didn't have a reaction to any of the ingredients, which was fantastic. I followed the mask up with a hydrating moisturizer and the next day my skin still felt supple.This is amazing stays on face so you can go about your business. The results are great rehydrated, firmer smoother looking skin. Great for that special day or pick me upWow!! This mask is seriously magical! I can't even explain it.

I'm a red head with very pale skin living in Texas so I am very careful what I use. The mask is a little tricky to place the first time but the amount of moisturizer that you get is incredible. It absorbs quickly with some residual after twenty minutes but it is easily massaged in after you take it off. Will be ordering moreWow!! This mask is seriously magical! I can't even explain it.

And you get 4 masks for $80 - wow!There's a great article about it in the April issue of Elle magazine.My skin looked and felt great after the mask. However, by the next morning, I was breaking out all over. The terrible breakout completely cancelled the "effect" of the mask. The masks went back;( If you don't have sensitive skin, this might work well for you. I'd be cautious though.
