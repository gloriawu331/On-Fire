Reasoning for purchase :*Scroll down for the actual review*
 My reasoning for purchasing this wasn't to give me a youthful appearance, but to actually tone my face. My face is the first thing that shows any sign of bloating or weight gain, and even if I've lost the weight, it'll stay in my cheeks the longest. With that being said, I purchased this in hopes of defining my cheek bones and to further utilize as preventative maintenance, since people in my age group are tending to get botox to prevent deep set lines.
 **Review after 6 weeks of use**:
 I've used this device at minimum 5x a week. I do the full face treatment with the default attachment & the ELE attachment (takes about 30 minutes all together).*
 *The Trinity Facial Toning Device definitely works for me and is fairly easy to use once you've done the proper research. My cheek bones and jaw are a little more defined. I can see a difference when I see photos or video clips that I'm in, and my face is more contoured. Overall skin tone has improved, and pores are smaller than before. The difference is not night and day, but the results are there.*The LIFTER Serum with Vitamin C & Hyaluronic Acid (sold for $84 by itself) that comes with this set works wonders in brightening dark spots, and helps even overall skin tone. I love using this right before I use the 24K Gold Complex Firm gel to get the most impact out of it as possible since you don't have to wash your face after using the gold gel primer, but even by itself without using the device is great. and does what's promised. I don't think it's worth the individual price tag for what's out there, but it works well when layering skin treatments.*The Gold Gel primer (valued at $39 by itself) is great for the mornings I tend to be a little more hurried and I don't want to have to wash it off...if it worked for me. It does dry faster, making the product more likely to be used up faster if you don't re-wet it. It tends to mess with any primers I layer on before my makeup application, and causes my makeup to break down faster throughout the day. In theory, it's nice, but I don't care for it.*The Regular Gel primer (valued at $12) works well and stays hydrated for a decent amount of time. You don't have to re-wet it as long as you use it strategically. However, you do have to wash it off your face after you're done with your device. Since I use a very gentle cleanser that's not stripping of my skin's barrier, this doesn't bother me too much.*The ELE attachment (valued at $149) does work well in areas that you want to focus the device's affects on. I have noticed the fine lines in my smile lines are almost completely diminished, and my lips do appear slightly fuller. I haven't seen much difference in my eye area, but I also don't have any issues there. I still run the device over my eyes for preventative maintenance. 
 **I'll give this set 4/5 stars for overall outcome and price tag.It does work for it's intended purposes in the means of contouring the face and evening overall skin tone.You can see a difference after several uses and it is the easiest thing to maintain and clean.I would rather have their Prep-N-Glow clothes instead of the Gold Primer. The habit that needs to be developed in order to see visible results makes this purchase questionable to dish out the coin (even though they claim that after 60 days you only need to use it 2-3x a week). 
 I recommend waiting until Sephora features their Semi-Annual sale perks of a percentage off your entire purchase if you are consider getting this.I just started about a month ago and have another month to see more changes. I have had a hard time keeping up with the recommended 5 treatments per week for 2 months. But, even being consistently at 4 Tim's a week, I notice a visible tightening in my skin. I am also using the wrinkle led attachment with it and I use the advanced program each time fyi.I don't know if the price and effort are with it. I'm 35 and have average skin for my age, so I was just hoping to tighten my jowls, around my eyes and under my chin. I have been using this for 3 weeks and, while I see a tiny improvement (and that may just be wishful thinking), it's a messy daily ritual that doesn't seem worth the time. I'll give it a full 60 days, hoping I'll see some noticeable results. If not, it will wind up being another piece of junk added to the cluster of devices added to my bathroom.I've had nuface treatments from my aesthetician, and when this kit came out, I had to treat myself. This is my botox without the needles. Worth the splurge!Reasoning for purchase :*Scroll down for the actual review*

With that being said, I purchased this in hopes of defining my cheek bones and to further utilize as preventative maintenance, since people in my age group are tending to get botox to prevent deep set lines.
 **Review after 6 weeks of use**:
 I've used this device at minimum 5x a week. I do the full face treatment with the default attachment & the ELE attachment (takes about 30 minutes all together).*
 *The Trinity Facial Toning Device definitely works for me and is fairly easy to use once you've done the proper research. My cheek bones and jaw are a little more defined. I can see a difference when I see photos or video clips that I'm in, and my face is more contoured. Overall skin tone has improved, and pores are smaller than before. The difference is not night and day, but the results are there.*The LIFTER Serum with Vitamin C & Hyaluronic Acid (sold for $84 by itself) that comes with this set works wonders in brightening dark spots, and helps even overall skin tone. I love using this right before I use the 24K Gold Complex Firm gel to get the most impact out of it as possible since you don't have to wash your face after using the gold gel primer, but even by itself without using the device is great. and does what's promised. I don't think it's worth the individual price tag for what's out there, but it works well when layering skin treatments.*The Gold Gel primer (valued at $39 by itself) is great for the mornings I tend to be a little more hurried and I don't want to have to wash it off...if it worked for me. It does dry faster, making the product more likely to be used up faster if you don't re-wet it. It tends to mess with any primers I layer on before my makeup application, and causes my makeup to break down faster throughout the day. In theory, it's nice, but I don't care for it.*The Regular Gel primer (valued at $12) works well and stays hydrated for a decent amount of time. You don't have to re-wet it as long as you use it strategically. However, you do have to wash it off your face after you're done with your device. Since I use a very gentle cleanser that's not stripping of my skin's barrier, this doesn't bother me too much.*The ELE attachment (valued at $149) does work well in areas that you want to focus the device's affects on. I have noticed the fine lines in my smile lines are almost completely diminished, and my lips do appear slightly fuller. I haven't seen much difference in my eye area, but I also don't have any issues there. I still run the device over my eyes for preventative maintenance. 
 **I'll give this set 4/5 stars for overall outcome and price tag.It does work for it's intended purposes in the means of contouring the face and evening overall skin tone.You can see a difference after several uses and it is the easiest thing to maintain and clean.I would rather have their Prep-N-Glow clothes instead of the Gold Primer. The habit that needs to be developed in order to see visible results makes this purchase questionable to dish out the coin (even though they claim that after 60 days you only need to use it 2-3x a week). 
 I recommend waiting until Sephora features their Semi-Annual sale perks of a percentage off your entire purchase if you are consider getting this.I just started about a month ago and have another month to see more changes. I have had a hard time keeping up with the recommended 5 treatments per week for 2 months. But, even being consistently at 4 Tim's a week, I notice a visible tightening in my skin. I am also using the wrinkle led attachment with it and I use the advanced program each time fyi.I don't know if the price and effort are with it. I'm 35 and have average skin for my age, so I was just hoping to tighten my jowls, around my eyes and under my chin. I have been using this for 3 weeks and, while I see a tiny improvement (and that may just be wishful thinking), it's a messy daily ritual that doesn't seem worth the time. I'll give it a full 60 days, hoping I'll see some noticeable results. If not, it will wind up being another piece of junk added to the cluster of devices added to my bathroom.I've had nuface treatments from my aesthetician, and when this kit came out, I had to treat myself. This is my botox without the needles. Worth the splurge!
