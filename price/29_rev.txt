I bought this product based on a referral from a friend of mine. She said it was gorgeous and worth the splurge. So I did a buying it, and I love it! The first one I bought was "dream obscene" and I didn't care for the color, it was a little bit too nude for me, but looks to be a nice shade for others with different skin tone. It just wasn't what I was looking for, but I still like the formula. So then I bought "I'll teach you", it is a wonderful bright fuchsia, that is very appropriate for daytime. I love how it has the self sharpening liner and the lipstick all in one. The packaging is gorgeous is exactly what you would expect from the Tom Ford product. I love the color, and I love how it applies. Some people have complained about a little bit of glitter in the lip liner, I did notice the global bit of glitter, but it's so faint that it's not even noticeable. Maybe it is in the red but it's definitely not in the fuchsia. I see others have complained about the price, but what do you expect? This is the Tom Ford product of course it's not going be inexpensive. This is a luxury brand, and of course going to have a luxury price tag. If you don't like the price tag, then don't buy the product.For the high price I paid I expected a lip liner and lipstick that was true color and stay power, I got neither. This product is no better the drug store cheap products!I wanted to love these because I had seen so many great reviews on Tom Ford products in the past. But these lipsticks are just "whatever". It's nice that a liner and lipstick are in one unit- that's convenient, so I'll give credit for that at least. The liner of #1 Public Display and #4 Show it Off both have gold glitter in it- which is confusing to me. Why would the glitter be in the liner when the liner is going to be covered up? Also, the liners are a lighter color than the lipstick. I can only think TF was going for the reverse ombre effect seen in a lot of Korean beauty- which would be cool if it worked. But the lip color is so much darker and opaque that this effect just doesn't happen. I wore #4 to work and it lasted about 5 hours before I noticed it had worn off in the center- no eating, drinking, kissing- nothing like that- just talking. The formula is opaque, creamy, glides on beautifully, and feels comfortable to wear. But the lipstick is much smaller than the standard lipstick bullet. I am not disappointed I bought these to try out- it's just that I expected something......I don't know....different? better? They are ok- not worth $53 though.Love love love this product, I bought this in the shade "secret escort", it's a perfect day-red. It's long lasting and so handy since the lip liner and the lipstick comes in one! The lip liner does have gold glitter in it but it enhances the red in this shade.I was hoping to love these but am not impressed. The lip liner has loads of chunky glitter and is so hard I broke the tip off during the first use. The lipstick itself is the type that slides around and emphasizes every lip line. The color was beautiful and the packaging is the definition of luxe, but I'm returning this asap.Excited Sephora is selling the Lip Contour Duos! Love 'em! I love lipliner and appreciate the convenience of a 2-in-1 product like this.
