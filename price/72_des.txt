 Clémentine California, new for 2017, is a sunny composition built around Clementine from Californiafruity, green, and sweet.

In Vanille Insensée, an electrical current runs through the subtle sweetness of vanilla, jasmine, and fresh lime to bond with rich oak moss, woods, and spicy coriander.

Bergamote Soleil is effervescent and lively with a soft hint of floral in the background. This unisex fragrance offers a sunny composition built around the freshness of bergamot from Calabria.
Orange Sanguine, a zesty and energizing burst of crushed ripe fruit, plays off sweet blood orange juice against bitter orange peel and sensual notes of geranium.
Mandarine Glaciale is a citrus, fresh fragrance with notes of mandarin from Calabria, ginger from China, and heart of vetiver from Haiti. The delectable scent casts a spell with cool notes over a juicy cocktail of balanced citrus notes.
Pomélo Paradis is a new and unexpected fragrance experience. Fresh and sparkling pomelo from Florida floats over rich notes of blackcurrant bud and the complexity of Haitian vetiver.
Sud Magnolia is a floral and fresh fragrance with notes of magnolia from Louisiana, bitter orange from Seville, and atlas cedarwood from Morocco.
