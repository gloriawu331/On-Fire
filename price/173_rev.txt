This eyeliner glides on so smooth. I love the color range for this product as well. I achieve the perfect cat eye every time with vanta, kobicha is a nice subtle brown and stealth & evergreen really help accentuate my hazel eyes.So I loved this eyeliner at first...thought I found my HG. Great pigment and color, the built-in insta-sharpener gives you that fine tip every time for precise application, I thought it had good staying power. I was sold...until I got toward the end and the tip kept breaking off. Everytime I would put it to my eye the tip cracked off at the base. This happened several times until it was completely out and I was left with one eye unfinished. Therefore, this eyeliner only lasted me less than a month without everyday use. For the high price of this product...that simply should not happen and because of this, breaking off of the tip, I will never repurchase. Beware.I love the feel, and the delivery of the color. I also love the way it works. The click and extend and the screw on top are the best system I've used (no more sharp edges when the center runs down) and the top doesn't fall off. The issue is that after a very short time I've got green running down my face. It may be an issue with my cleanser or eye cream, but I'm not going to NOT clean or moisturize. That said, I haven't stopped using it. Just making sure I pay attention to the drift. (And green drift is a LOT less noticeable than black).I received a sample of the blue color and loved it so much I bought the black. Usually eyeliners without sharpeners can dry out and crack, but this hasn't happened in the time I've had it, even after accidentally leaving the top off or not closing it all the way. I love the line it makes and it has amazing staying power. Highly recommend.This eyeliner glides on so smooth. I love the color range for this product as well.
