I haven been using Clinique for 15 years and have reached yet another stage in life requiring me to change up my daily moisturizer. I've used SuperDefense since it was launched but now need a little extra help with fine lines so I decided to try Repairwear. 
 Repairwear Laser Focus feels light and creamy during application and soaks right in for a soft, velvety finish under both powder and liquid foundations. (I use Combination-Oily to Oily formula.) I haven't used it long enough to see results long-term, but my skin is already firmer with fewer fine lines after 3 weeks of use.This cream sat on the top of my skin (didn't seep in) and when rubbed in, created a grainy, dry texture. The sun screen seemed to be the major problem. My face was white and had dry, white patches like I had a bunch of acne cream on. Aside from being a sunscreen (while I'm asleep at night?) this cream served no function.I haven been using Clinique for 15 years and have reached yet another stage in life requiring me to change up my daily moisturizer.
