This is a little too harsh for my skin. I have combination skin prone to blackheads and a blemish now and then. This dries out my skin a little too much.. I would imagine people with oily skin would benefit from it. I use the "original" method series now and that works for meI started using this 3 step method: cleanse, polish, then nourish, along with the tria blue light device from sephora, and my skin is completely transforming. I used to to use Retin-A but decided to stop and could not get my skin to stop breaking out. I tried many other products and I eat very clean, but still at 35 I have acne and every little spot scars. My pigmentation is clearing and I rarely have spots now. It is amazing.The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because the packaging doesn't work well for this cleanser; it accumulates in the cap and is hard to get out. A pump would work better for this.i really like this product! this is actually the second step to the blemish control line on lancer (the polish is the first step). this makes my skin SQUEEKY clean without it feeling dry. It doesn't lather up so crazy, but just enough for it to feel nice on my skin. it has beads in it, but not really exfoliating.I love this cleanser. The beads make my face feel really fresh, but isn't too drying on my skin. When I'm done washing my face there is this amazing cooling effect and I feel so refreshed. It has helped a lot with my acne as well.This is a little too harsh for my skin. I have combination skin prone to blackheads and a blemish now and then. This dries out my skin a little too much..
