I love this oil so much! I use it every night!!I never break out and I have very dry sensitive skin. Once I started using this oil it made my skin so soft and moisturized but it made me breakout like crazy! I returned it cause I didn't find any other good uses for it. Im really sad cause I was really looking forward to this oil to be my HOLY GRAIL but it just isnt.I'm so in love with this oil. I have dry, sensitive skin and am always on the hunt for something that will give me a healthy, hydrated glow. I use this at night before bed and I will usually mix a drop in with my daytime moisturizer as well. It makes my face so soft and looks beautiful under makeup. This gave me NO irritation, which is pretty rare when I start using a new skin care product. I wish they would rethink the packaging as it tends to leak a bit, but that's a small price to pay. I can tell this bottle will last me forever as well, which is always a plus.This stuff is amazing for moisture... my skin has never been so soft. I also have extremely sensitive skin around my eyes and this works perfectly as a gentle makeup remover. Love it!I put this on every morning and every night on my face. it does a great job of moisturizing and doesn't break my out at all. i have really sensitive and acne prone skin. but this really has helped my skin improve over time. Also its a great oil makeup remover.I'm usually the 1%, the one who gets a breakout from a product everyone else loves.This oil clogged my pores and made my skin look dirty, and actually seemed to dry it out. Also, since its coconut oil, the product is hardened in the bottle unless you run it under warm water or are in a warm place. I had to scrape the product off the dropper to apply.I have a tough time finding things I can actually stick with. Most beauty products I buy, I use a couple times and either give it away or toss it. I did not buy this from sephora I bought it over the summer directly from kopari and Im still using it. 
 It works really well on eye makeup and it doesnt cause stinging as most makeup removers do and I can't help but feel like its also really good for my barely there lashes they need all the help they can get ! I also use a little when I get dry patches in my brows or on my cheeks my skin literally drinks this stuff without getting the dreaded breakouts most moisturizers leave me with. 
 While I am disappointed to see the price has gone up quite a bit since I bought it (I felt like it was already a little pricey to begin with) I guess thats the price you pay for the convenience of purchasing through a third party retailer.I absolutely love this oil for the face! I have sensitive skin and it doesn't cause breakouts, if anything I feel like it helps any issues. The thing I'm most impressed with is, I'm in my early 30's and have the typical laugh lines starting to become more apparent and this is the first product I've ever used that I can say I've actually noticed some softening of these lines, specifically my crows feet. It's not a miracle product but after a few months of use I can say I notice a difference. Yes the product does harden just like normal coconut oil but I just put it by my fireplace and it's good to go. In the summer I guess I'll just put it outside in the sun for a few mins and it'll be fine lol. Wish they sold it in store but it's a definite must try!I like the texture and how smooth it is! I've been looking to buy a new face oil and the fact that it's organic only makes it better and price wise is good too since I know it will last long time. I used it today and I put like 4 drops on my face (got too excited) and it was definelty too much. Only 1 small drop is enough for the whole face!It makes my skin feel so soft. I've been using this instead of a moisturizer, and I love it. It's light on my skin and doesn't feel oily.The oil is great for wrinkles! Before this purchase , my skin was starting to show the first signs of wrinkles. I'm 31 and before buying this I would moisturizer religiously, since high school! For you young ladies out there, you're never too young to start moisturizing. Especially if you wear makeup daily. Anyway, I saw I was starting to get crows feet, a thin wrinkle going horizontally on my forehead and my laugh lines looked deeper. I received my purchase and noticed it was really oily, one drop could literally cover half my face and still feel a little bit of oil. So I thought to myself, this I would be great to use right before bedtime. I used it mostly for my crows feets, forehead, laugh lines and neck. When I woke up my skin looked smooth, much smoother than the day before. I was really impressed and happy I found my fountain of youth lol It really put my baby wrinkles to a halt. The oil is so worth it if you're seeing signs of aging or use before the signs. Inevitably we all will look older but this oil will slow down the process. If you already have deep wrinkles or you're a particular age, it will work for you too. I used this on my husbands forehead after exfoliating his skin and his very deep deep wrinkles we're less harsh, extremely less harsh! This is our experience and we're in our 30's so it might not be the same for everyone..but it might.the product itself is incredible. really really really good, but the packaging is horrible. It leaks all over the place when you put the dropper back into the bottle. I transferred the product into another empty oil container I had lying around and it was much better.Lightweight, very moisturizing and smells great.Having super oily and breakout prone skin I was always hesitant to use an oil on my face. This has been incredible. It doesn't clog my pores. I use it at night and I wake up with soft skin and it has actually helped clear my skin up. Definitely recommend.My fav Kopari product! Smells great and doesn't feel too greasy. I love this for all over my face before bed. Only downside is I've noticed it leaks out after putting the dropper back in the bottle. Plus it's glass so it's not very travel friendly if it gets knocked around or dropped. Hope the packaging will change. But a little goes a long way and it's great for my dry skin!I love this oil so much! I use it every night!!I love this oil so much!

In the summer I guess I'll just put it outside in the sun for a few mins and it'll be fine lol. Wish they sold it in store but it's a definite must try!I like the texture and how smooth it is! I've been looking to buy a new face oil and the fact that it's organic only makes it better and price wise is good too since I know it will last long time. I used it today and I put like 4 drops on my face (got too excited) and it was definelty too much. Only 1 small drop is enough for the whole face!It makes my skin feel so soft. I've been using this instead of a moisturizer, and I love it. It's light on my skin and doesn't feel oily.The oil is great for wrinkles! Before this purchase , my skin was starting to show the first signs of wrinkles. I'm 31 and before buying this I would moisturizer religiously, since high school! For you young ladies out there, you're never too young to start moisturizing. Especially if you wear makeup daily. Anyway, I saw I was starting to get crows feet, a thin wrinkle going horizontally on my forehead and my laugh lines looked deeper. I received my purchase and noticed it was really oily, one drop could literally cover half my face and still feel a little bit of oil. So I thought to myself, this I would be great to use right before bedtime. I used it mostly for my crows feets, forehead, laugh lines and neck. When I woke up my skin looked smooth, much smoother than the day before. I was really impressed and happy I found my fountain of youth lol It really put my baby wrinkles to a halt. The oil is so worth it if you're seeing signs of aging or use before the signs. Inevitably we all will look older but this oil will slow down the process. If you already have deep wrinkles or you're a particular age, it will work for you too. I used this on my husbands forehead after exfoliating his skin and his very deep deep wrinkles we're less harsh, extremely less harsh! This is our experience and we're in our 30's so it might not be the same for everyone..but it might.the product itself is incredible. really really really good, but the packaging is horrible. It leaks all over the place when you put the dropper back into the bottle. I transferred the product into another empty oil container I had lying around and it was much better.I love this oil so much! I use it every night!!I never break out and I have very dry sensitive skin. Once I started using this oil it made my skin so soft and moisturized but it made me breakout like crazy! I returned it cause I didn't find any other good uses for it. Im really sad cause I was really looking forward to this oil to be my HOLY GRAIL but it just isnt.I'm so in love with this oil. I have dry, sensitive skin and am always on the hunt for something that will give me a healthy, hydrated glow. I use this at night before bed and I will usually mix a drop in with my daytime moisturizer as well. It makes my face so soft and looks beautiful under makeup. This gave me NO irritation, which is pretty rare when I start using a new skin care product. I wish they would rethink the packaging as it tends to leak a bit, but that's a small price to pay. I can tell this bottle will last me forever as well, which is always a plus.This stuff is amazing for moisture... my skin has never been so soft. I also have extremely sensitive skin around my eyes and this works perfectly as a gentle makeup remover. Love it!I put this on every morning and every night on my face. it does a great job of moisturizing and doesn't break my out at all. i have really sensitive and acne prone skin. but this really has helped my skin improve over time. Also its a great oil makeup remover.I'm usually the 1%, the one who gets a breakout from a product everyone else loves.This oil clogged my pores and made my skin look dirty, and actually seemed to dry it out. Also, since its coconut oil, the product is hardened in the bottle unless you run it under warm water or are in a warm place. I had to scrape the product off the dropper to apply.I have a tough time finding things I can actually stick with. Most beauty products I buy, I use a couple times and either give it away or toss it. I did not buy this from sephora I bought it over the summer directly from kopari and Im still using it. 
 It works really well on eye makeup and it doesnt cause stinging as most makeup removers do and I can't help but feel like its also really good for my barely there lashes they need all the help they can get ! I also use a little when I get dry patches in my brows or on my cheeks my skin literally drinks this stuff without getting the dreaded breakouts most moisturizers leave me with. 
 While I am disappointed to see the price has gone up quite a bit since I bought it (I felt like it was already a little pricey to begin with) I guess thats the price you pay for the convenience of purchasing through a third party retailer.I absolutely love this oil for the face! I have sensitive skin and it doesn't cause breakouts, if anything I feel like it helps any issues. The thing I'm most impressed with is, I'm in my early 30's and have the typical laugh lines starting to become more apparent and this is the first product I've ever used that I can say I've actually noticed some softening of these lines, specifically my crows feet. It's not a miracle product but after a few months of use I can say I notice a difference.

I had to scrape the product off the dropper to apply.I have a tough time finding things I can actually stick with. Most beauty products I buy, I use a couple times and either give it away or toss it. I did not buy this from sephora I bought it over the summer directly from kopari and Im still using it. 
 It works really well on eye makeup and it doesnt cause stinging as most makeup removers do and I can't help but feel like its also really good for my barely there lashes they need all the help they can get ! I also use a little when I get dry patches in my brows or on my cheeks my skin literally drinks this stuff without getting the dreaded breakouts most moisturizers leave me with. 
 While I am disappointed to see the price has gone up quite a bit since I bought it (I felt like it was already a little pricey to begin with) I guess thats the price you pay for the convenience of purchasing through a third party retailer.I love this oil so much! I use it every night!!I never break out and I have very dry sensitive skin. Once I started using this oil it made my skin so soft and moisturized but it made me breakout like crazy! I returned it cause I didn't find any other good uses for it. Im really sad cause I was really looking forward to this oil to be my HOLY GRAIL but it just isnt.I'm so in love with this oil. I have dry, sensitive skin and am always on the hunt for something that will give me a healthy, hydrated glow. I use this at night before bed and I will usually mix a drop in with my daytime moisturizer as well. It makes my face so soft and looks beautiful under makeup. This gave me NO irritation, which is pretty rare when I start using a new skin care product. I wish they would rethink the packaging as it tends to leak a bit, but that's a small price to pay. I can tell this bottle will last me forever as well, which is always a plus.This stuff is amazing for moisture... my skin has never been so soft. I also have extremely sensitive skin around my eyes and this works perfectly as a gentle makeup remover. Love it!I put this on every morning and every night on my face. it does a great job of moisturizing and doesn't break my out at all. i have really sensitive and acne prone skin. but this really has helped my skin improve over time.

 While I am disappointed to see the price has gone up quite a bit since I bought it (I felt like it was already a little pricey to begin with) I guess thats the price you pay for the convenience of purchasing through a third party retailer.I absolutely love this oil for the face! I have sensitive skin and it doesn't cause breakouts, if anything I feel like it helps any issues. The thing I'm most impressed with is, I'm in my early 30's and have the typical laugh lines starting to become more apparent and this is the first product I've ever used that I can say I've actually noticed some softening of these lines, specifically my crows feet. It's not a miracle product but after a few months of use I can say I notice a difference. Yes the product does harden just like normal coconut oil but I just put it by my fireplace and it's good to go. In the summer I guess I'll just put it outside in the sun for a few mins and it'll be fine lol. Wish they sold it in store but it's a definite must try!I love this oil so much!

I've been looking to buy a new face oil and the fact that it's organic only makes it better and price wise is good too since I know it will last long time.

I've been using this instead of a moisturizer, and I love it. It's light on my skin and doesn't feel oily.The oil is great for wrinkles! Before this purchase , my skin was starting to show the first signs of wrinkles. I'm 31 and before buying this I would moisturizer religiously, since high school! For you young ladies out there, you're never too young to start moisturizing. Especially if you wear makeup daily. Anyway, I saw I was starting to get crows feet, a thin wrinkle going horizontally on my forehead and my laugh lines looked deeper. I received my purchase and noticed it was really oily, one drop could literally cover half my face and still feel a little bit of oil. So I thought to myself, this I would be great to use right before bedtime. I used it mostly for my crows feets, forehead, laugh lines and neck. When I woke up my skin looked smooth, much smoother than the day before. I was really impressed and happy I found my fountain of youth lol It really put my baby wrinkles to a halt. The oil is so worth it if you're seeing signs of aging or use before the signs. Inevitably we all will look older but this oil will slow down the process. If you already have deep wrinkles or you're a particular age, it will work for you too. I used this on my husbands forehead after exfoliating his skin and his very deep deep wrinkles we're less harsh, extremely less harsh! This is our experience and we're in our 30's so it might not be the same for everyone..but it might.I love this oil so much! I use it every night!!I never break out and I have very dry sensitive skin. Once I started using this oil it made my skin so soft and moisturized but it made me breakout like crazy!

I transferred the product into another empty oil container I had lying around and it was much better.Lightweight, very moisturizing and smells great.Having super oily and breakout prone skin I was always hesitant to use an oil on my face. This has been incredible. It doesn't clog my pores. I use it at night and I wake up with soft skin and it has actually helped clear my skin up. Definitely recommend.I love this oil so much! I use it every night!!I never break out and I have very dry sensitive skin. Once I started using this oil it made my skin so soft and moisturized but it made me breakout like crazy! I returned it cause I didn't find any other good uses for it. Im really sad cause I was really looking forward to this oil to be my HOLY GRAIL but it just isnt.I'm so in love with this oil. I have dry, sensitive skin and am always on the hunt for something that will give me a healthy, hydrated glow. I use this at night before bed and I will usually mix a drop in with my daytime moisturizer as well. It makes my face so soft and looks beautiful under makeup. This gave me NO irritation, which is pretty rare when I start using a new skin care product. I wish they would rethink the packaging as it tends to leak a bit, but that's a small price to pay. I can tell this bottle will last me forever as well, which is always a plus.This stuff is amazing for moisture... my skin has never been so soft. I also have extremely sensitive skin around my eyes and this works perfectly as a gentle makeup remover. Love it!I put this on every morning and every night on my face. it does a great job of moisturizing and doesn't break my out at all. i have really sensitive and acne prone skin. but this really has helped my skin improve over time. Also its a great oil makeup remover.I'm usually the 1%, the one who gets a breakout from a product everyone else loves.This oil clogged my pores and made my skin look dirty, and actually seemed to dry it out. Also, since its coconut oil, the product is hardened in the bottle unless you run it under warm water or are in a warm place. I had to scrape the product off the dropper to apply.I have a tough time finding things I can actually stick with. Most beauty products I buy, I use a couple times and either give it away or toss it. I did not buy this from sephora I bought it over the summer directly from kopari and Im still using it. 
 It works really well on eye makeup and it doesnt cause stinging as most makeup removers do and I can't help but feel like its also really good for my barely there lashes they need all the help they can get ! I also use a little when I get dry patches in my brows or on my cheeks my skin literally drinks this stuff without getting the dreaded breakouts most moisturizers leave me with. 
 While I am disappointed to see the price has gone up quite a bit since I bought it (I felt like it was already a little pricey to begin with) I guess thats the price you pay for the convenience of purchasing through a third party retailer.I absolutely love this oil for the face! I have sensitive skin and it doesn't cause breakouts, if anything I feel like it helps any issues. The thing I'm most impressed with is, I'm in my early 30's and have the typical laugh lines starting to become more apparent and this is the first product I've ever used that I can say I've actually noticed some softening of these lines, specifically my crows feet. It's not a miracle product but after a few months of use I can say I notice a difference. Yes the product does harden just like normal coconut oil but I just put it by my fireplace and it's good to go. In the summer I guess I'll just put it outside in the sun for a few mins and it'll be fine lol. Wish they sold it in store but it's a definite must try!I like the texture and how smooth it is! I've been looking to buy a new face oil and the fact that it's organic only makes it better and price wise is good too since I know it will last long time. I used it today and I put like 4 drops on my face (got too excited) and it was definelty too much. Only 1 small drop is enough for the whole face!It makes my skin feel so soft. I've been using this instead of a moisturizer, and I love it. It's light on my skin and doesn't feel oily.The oil is great for wrinkles! Before this purchase , my skin was starting to show the first signs of wrinkles. I'm 31 and before buying this I would moisturizer religiously, since high school! For you young ladies out there, you're never too young to start moisturizing. Especially if you wear makeup daily. Anyway, I saw I was starting to get crows feet, a thin wrinkle going horizontally on my forehead and my laugh lines looked deeper. I received my purchase and noticed it was really oily, one drop could literally cover half my face and still feel a little bit of oil. So I thought to myself, this I would be great to use right before bedtime. I used it mostly for my crows feets, forehead, laugh lines and neck. When I woke up my skin looked smooth, much smoother than the day before. I was really impressed and happy I found my fountain of youth lol It really put my baby wrinkles to a halt. The oil is so worth it if you're seeing signs of aging or use before the signs. Inevitably we all will look older but this oil will slow down the process. If you already have deep wrinkles or you're a particular age, it will work for you too. I used this on my husbands forehead after exfoliating his skin and his very deep deep wrinkles we're less harsh, extremely less harsh!

Smells great and doesn't feel too greasy. I love this for all over my face before bed. Only downside is I've noticed it leaks out after putting the dropper back in the bottle. Plus it's glass so it's not very travel friendly if it gets knocked around or dropped. Hope the packaging will change. But a little goes a long way and it's great for my dry skin!I love this oil so much! I use it every night!!I never break out and I have very dry sensitive skin.

But a little goes a long way and it's great for my dry skin!I got this as a sample bottle and I haven't stopped using it! It's really great for refreshing my curls in the morning (always a fun task) and it doesn't leave any oily residue at all, which I have a huge pet peeve for. I am planning on buying the full size bottle once my sample is out!
