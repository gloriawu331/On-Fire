What it is:
 An ultrasoft natural-hair brush designed to dust highlighter onto the high points of the cheeks. 

What it does:
 This highlighter brush gives cheekbones a lift and warms the face with soft, incandescent light. Surratt Beauty is committed to the Japanese philosophy of monozukuri; each high-quality brush is crafted from hand-tied natural fibers by a skilled artisan.

What else you need to know:
 The Surratt Beauty line of ergonomic brushes is designed to do most of the work for you. During the first few uses, some natural bristle shedding is normal and should be expected.  To maintain the integrity of your brush, wash with gentle shampoo at least once a month. Reshape the natural hairs and lay flat on a towel to dry.

"This brush also fits beautifully into the orbital area under the eye for setting concealer with powder."Troy SurrattWhat it is:
