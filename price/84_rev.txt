Yes...GHD maybe overpriced...but I do like my purchase. First of all, I like the fact that the bag and hardware is black (I am in my mid 40s and nothing flashy please). I also like the performance of the straightener. Easy to use and heat up very quickly. Finally the value added in this kit is very decent. So all in all, I like it. No buyer's remorse :-)Yes...GHD maybe overpriced...but I do like my purchase. First of all, I like the fact that the bag and hardware is black (I am in my mid 40s and nothing flashy please).
