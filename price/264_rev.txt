They are pricey and I really don't see any difference between this pads and any other you can refrigerate and use to help with puffiness...The product that comes with the pads is too liquid and stays in the recipient.Got one pair from my friend and was excited to try it out.
 It's gel-like that would stick to your face without you laying down, kinda convenient. It feels cool to the touch on my face. But after using it, I don't feel any different at all.
 I guess it's soothing cuz it's cool? But no de-puffing whatsoever.And for about $20 a pair, I would say it's not worth it.I buy these on a regular basis and they absolutely work. They rehydrate the under eye and keep it that way for at least a couple days after. When I don't use these I notice the makeup gets into my fine lines under my eyes/creases, whereas when I use these it literally takes off a few years off my under eyes, The fine lines are big-time minimized. I realize they are expensive, but there's a reason why they are.This product is expensive but I do really think it works well. I use it only once in a while but when I do I am always amazed at the difference. I think I look 10 years younger at least and it usually lasts a good five days before it starts going the other direction. Gets rid of a good deal of the black under eye and just all around brightens, firms and cools . In 10 minutes that is special in my book.I very much appreciate these eye patches. Leave it on for 10 minutes and my eye area looks dramatically firm and brighter. Each patch comes in a tightly sealed container perfect for travelling. After the ten minutes I remove the patches and rub the remainder into the undereye . Looks so good. I love it!It lost a star because obviously for 123$ that's about 20$ per eye patch set. Very expensive . But I don't think I can ever give it up.It’s true that the price is very high, but I would say it TOTALLY worth it. Super hydrating and the result STAYS. I use it 3 times a week, and my dry lines around the eye fade away markedly, and also the puffiness seems a whole better. Haven't seen any result for my dark circle though. Strongly recommended.Did not seem to do anything. Sending back.
