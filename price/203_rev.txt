(A Close 2nd is tarte's waterproof Amazonian clay Concealer stick although it is much heavier than Surratt's )This concealer definitely surpasses the cle de peau concealer and becomes my favorite! I have dry skin but this surratt product leaves me no dry patches during winters.I have two brown spots on my cheek that really annoy me because otherwise I have clear paper white skin so they look really obvious. I have been looking for a concealer for years that could cover these up but have never found the right one – even the ones that claim 100% coverage. I walked around Sephora one evening and literally tried every concealer I could to see what might work. This one was way ahead of every other product. Amazingly it’s invisible on the skin but totally covers the discoloration on my cheek. I was shocked by the price but, seeing as I’d found my miracle solution I dished the dollars out and will try and make it last!This is a nice concealer that doesn't cake or fall in the crease of the under eye. I just didn't choose the right color because I need something with a peach tone too also eliminate the green in the corners of my eyes. This one would be fine with a color corrector underneath, but by itself it's only brightening.This is my favorite concealer, and I've tried them all- including Cle de Peau and La Mer. Surratt's concealer in "1" is the Only concealer I have ever found that is truly a perfect match for my paper-white skin, and I love the twist-up stick application. Although it's described as "creamy," the texture is rather dry, but I promise you if you take the extra two seconds to pat and push the concealer into the skin, it leaves the most gorgeous, perfect, invisible finish that lasts all day. It perfects while remaining undetectable. It's insanely expensive, but it's also Holy Grail material.I was looking for a concealer, in stick form, twist up, easy to apply with fingers and could act as a highlighter for undereye, above cheekbone, etc areas. I generally don't like products that are fussy. I walked around the store and literally tried every product that fit the above description regardless of brand or cost. Surprisingly, this was the winner by far. I dabbed it right on the problem areas, smoothed it out with my fingers and it was perfect. Doesn't sit in your creases, has a nice ever so slightly dewy look. I even went to a different store to compare against Cle de Peau and it still won. Even the counter rep liked it better (on me, that is - everyone is diff). It feels a little dry - you definitely want to just dab it on. It's not full coverage. Price per oz, it's ungodly expensive. But you really only need a tiny bit. I'm glad I found it but not enthusiastic that it costs so much!THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH COVERAGE ,VERY DRY I COULDNT SPREAD ON NICELY. CREASE UNDER EYE TOO.I opened the box and thought, did Sephora send me the wrong size because this looks like a deluxe sample and not something I paid $50 for. Needless to say, I checked the labels and the website, and yes, it's that tiny.
 Apart from the size, the concealer's great. It's buildable to medium coverage and lightweight and the color match was really good.so easy to apply and very efficient. Covers everything.
