I am a very fair skinned redhead and I live in the desert. Sunscreen is just not optional for me, it's a must. I constantly search out and try new products in the hope of finding "the one". This is it. I've been using Tatcha for quite a while which I thought was as close to perfect as sunscreen could get. It doesn't hold a candle to this. This applies and melts into the skin like skincare. How they did this, I don't know. Don't care either, as long as TF keeps making it. It also works very well as a primer. No pilling, no sliding, just lays down a really smooth base. Yes, it is awfully expensive for 1 oz. I'm ordering multiples, that's how good it is.Not sure what is in this stuff but this... this is freaking AMAZING. For some reason I thought this was mostly SPF with a side-function of some primer capabilities. But no joke this is an amazing PRIMER. Easily blows all my other primers out of the water - I cant think off the top of my head something that is comparable. I just put it on today and my makeup looks... flawless. And I didnt even use a BeautyBlender today!! I want to keep looking in the mirror because I cant believe what I see. I would never describe my makeup as being flawless in general because of certain areas where I have noticeable texture on my skin. It can make application of certain products more difficult than it needs to be, but with this my skin looks SO SMOOTH, and my makeup application looks like I got it done by a pro - that flawless, polished feel of skin-loving makeup. I feel like this would be a great base for wedding makeup. It works hard and feels like nothing on the skin. It doesnt have a silicone feel like most primers, it actually feels more like a lightweight moisturizer and absorbs quickly. No greasy afterfeel on fingers either. Easiest application primer - no need to concentrate on certain areas, or deal with pilling particles. One and done - which is extra points in my book.
 The obvious cons of this is the price, and you will find the size of the tube is really small(enough to fit in your hand), but yowza, I cant say that I have a desire to go back to $20-$30 primer after this. Mind blown. Cant believe Im saying this, but hopefully this is not limited edition.this is the best primer yet. a little pricey...but worth every penny. It goes on beautifully and gives my face a glow. Protects my skin is a plus! love this.Okay I know this is very expensive. But I have tried everything from Shiseido to Tatcha to Chanel, and I've officially found my holy grail sunscreen. It leaves a beautiful glow to your skin, without any grease or shimmer. Meanwhile, it also sits perfectly under makeup. In fact, my makeup looked a lot better. I received so many compliments on my skin since I've started using this. And no, this isn't just like any glowy primer. I've used everything from becca to Laura mercier to Armani for glowy primers. This just smoothes and blurs the skin while providing high protection. I sincerely hope this isn't limited.I am a very fair skinned redhead and I live in the desert. Sunscreen is just not optional for me, it's a must.
