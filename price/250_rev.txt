No broken promises- this product delivers and some. U get a oil that actually works. I use a lot of oils from cheap to expensive but this is the real thing. I have a thyroid condition which can make everything dryer, this oil deliversi bought this elixir at some boutique about a year ago because i wasn't willing to buy it without seeing and trying it in person. If you already use rahua products you will love this. Its natural it smells like the other Rahua products and a little goes a long way. I like to use it by mixing it with the omega 9 mask. I get amazing results. I put about half the dropper and mix it with the mask leave it on for 15 minutes and my hair is so fresh and has volume.Okay let's start by saying that this stuff is expensive as $#@! But it is worth every penny! I have been using Rahua shampoo and conditioner for a couple of months now and have had wonderful results from those, I figured I'd take advantage of the VIB sale and snag this elixir. I was skeptical since I have very fine hair with an oily scalp. Other oils, that are loaded with silicones, have made my hair feel disgusting. This one however is a miracle! It soaks into the hair and makes my tangly unmanageable hair silky and easy to brush. My hair feels bouncy and light even with this oil. I only use 1-2 drops while my hair is damp and it makes all the difference! I don't think I'll ever go without this stuff. My hair feels better and less damaged each time I use it.This works. Other oils sit on your hair, but this one actually ABSORBS into your hair. I have the most dry and frizzy hair and my hair has never been shinnier and split ends mended. It doesn't even claim to mend split ends yet it does. I've never been floored by a hair-care product before. I also got the travel set to try out their shampoos/conditioners and they are equally great. My hair is so lush now. Just shocking. The only down side is that given the gardenia enfleurage, I assumed i'd get a strong gardenia scent but i don't really smell it. It just kinds adds to the palo santo scent which is still ok as unlike some reviewers, i LOVE Palo Santo! It's one of my fav essential oils and the fact that it can only be extracted from the dead branches of the tree (that can't be poached as the tree must die naturally) makes it very sacred to me...i mean, call me macabre, but how beautiful is that?Purchased this after watching Tati's WTF $175 Miracle Hair Oil video on YouTube - personally I love the smell of Rahua products this stuff smells just like the shampoo does, I've been dying my hair for years and this stuff is definitely holy grail status for me! A little bit of this stuff goes a long way (I use 2-3 drops on damp hair before blow drying with my DryBar Buttercup blow dryer) my hair length is middle of my back, average thickness. You can use this oil on wet or dry hair... it will help you get a shiny blowout and a drop afterwards on ends before flat ironing and my hair is like silk and catches the light... this stuff is pricey but the results are worth it...No broken promises- this product delivers and some.
