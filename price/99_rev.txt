I'm almost done with the bottle and I don't see any results. Left skin immediately feeling ok, but nothing amazing. Very disappointing because it's so expensive!!Actually this is so freaking good, I have no idea why the ratings are low. After getting a travel set I fell in *love* with Omorovicza products, and those were really just the basics--the Foaming Cleanser, the Queen of Hungary Mist, and the Balancing Moisturizer. I am not one who is frequently impressed by "basic" skincare so to say this blew my mind is saying a lot. Not only are they absolutely luxurious, INCREDIBLE-smelling, well-designed and simple products, but they do something really unusual for my skin (and I have 3 Ikea bags' worth of skincare; I try everything, including top-end anti-aging stuff, all the time). It's hard to describe what changed about my skin but it just looked better in the way that a baby's skin looks better than everyone else's. No imperfections to speak of and everything was improved, from firmness to dullness to pores: everything. And this was just using the "basic" products in the trial kit. Finally I branched out and have tried the Rejuvenating Night Cream (really nice, but not as good as the best night creams I've tried); the cleansing mask (great); the complexion corrector (meh); the Copper Peel (ridiculously amazing); the Frankincense oil (nice) and the Blue Diamond mask (great). Of all of these, the only ones that have entered my HG pantheon are the basic products, the Copper Peel, and THIS product, the Radiance Renewal Serum. Night after night I cannot believe how good this makes my skin look. Yes, it has a lot of alcohol, but it also has a lot of Hungarian Thermal Water, and that ingredient is apparently not a joke. I will say I got a little addicted and started using it day and night, and then when I pulled back to using it more rarely, I got some breakouts, so I think your skin does get used to it. But now, using it a couple nights a week, I can't say how much I love it. I am on my second bottle at full price and would never be without it. THE BEST.Very tacky serum which didn't do anything to moisturize my dehydrated skin.Based on the review below, I just wanted to inform anyone who's considering omorovicza products to please keep in mind sephora does not provide a full list of ingredients.A full list for each product can be found on the Omorovicza websiteRead the ingredients list before you buy this. It's mostly alcohol and different fragrances. Scandalous!!I've never had luck with serums. I have combination skin but my main problem has always been a dull complexion. Most serums (high end and low) make me oily and make me break out all over. This was the first I've tried that does not do that and makes my skin smooth and supple. It also made my skin look so much brighter/more radiant underneath my day moisturizer that I've been wearing less makeup. At night I just wear it on it's own after cleansing and my skin has already improved significantly in less than two weeks.
 I would recommend you try this if you're looking to give life to dull skin and can spare the cash. It is pricey but Its worth it to me AND since you only need to use a tiny amount this pretty little bottle looks like it'll go a long way.I'm almost done with the bottle and I don't see any results.
