I'm excited for the palette, purchased it without reading any reviews. But when I received it, and I pulled out the last years limited edition palette found out the color selection is exactly SAME!!!! The only thing different is the packaging. Why does Givenchy do this?? Run out of eyeshadow colors??I expected this palette to be very pigmented because of the price but this offers no pigmentation and is very sheer.This is the worst palette I have ever come across. There is no pigmentation, its dry, patchy, cheap packaging and crazy expensive. I have drugstore palettes that are better than this garbage.This palette is a bit pricey, so you'll be paying a little extra just for the name. The shadows (when used dry) are quite sheer & buildable to a certain point. If you use them wet (especially the shimmery shadows) the pigmentation is increased & you have a wider variety with the looks you can create using different combinations of the shadows. I feel like this palette works best in combination with other palettes. The white shimmery shade is beautiful--try it with a damp brush or sponge applicator! I have fair skin & the warm nude shade works fine as a transition for me, but one of the brown shades is a lot lighter than the other when swatched out/applied to the skin. The darker brown can be used wet as a darker liner against the lash line. You will essentially have a natural neutral eye look, OR a deeper smoky eye with this palette. If you're looking for other eye looks, I would definitely suggest a different palette!I was very shocked at how cheap the packaging was when I received this palette. It comes with old school cheap eye shadow applicators as well. The shadows can not compete with brands that are much cheaper on the market right now and the palette is way overpriced. I had to double take to make sure it was actually givenchy and not a knock off brand. I was so underwhelmed. If you are gonna charge this much for a palette it needs to be packaged better with a real bush, better pigmentation and more than 6 basic colors.It is expensive but the colors are good for doing a shimmery look as the description says. Someone earlier complained there is no transition colors but they are totally mistaken these colors work well together and can be blended to create several nude shimmer looks. I think it is very pretty and if you collect makeup then you should give it a try! If you are not interested in spending this much money then try another brand... but if you do want to splurge then it is a good gift for yourself! I do wish there was a better applicator. But it's overall very pretty!This palette is gorgeous! Go check it out for yourself. Same Givenchy quality and pigment as their other shadows. Make your own opinion. Love!you would think a $66 pallet with 6 gorgeous shadows would be a go to pallet but it is The exact opposite. There isn't one transitions shade and this pallet unless you want to put a shimmer in your Crease and how are you supposed to make a look with horribly coordinated shades this was a total waste.
