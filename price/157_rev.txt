Bought it for my bf. I think it's convenient for being waterproof and small so it's portable for when he travels. Cleans well but I'm not sure about the minimizing winkles and fine lines. Probably have to wait couple months to see the resultsI'm a woman but bought this one because I liked the color best. I started using it about a month ago and absolutely love this scrubber! My skin has never been smoother, pores aren't as noticeable on my face, makeup applies more evenly and I swear my skin now glows; I've stopped using highlighter! I use this scrubber with an exfoliating salicylic acid scrub daily. I have combination/oily skin for reference.I started my new skin routine 3 months ago and I purchased this when I bought all new skin care products. I love how gentle it is, yet gets my skin so much cleaner than just using my hands. The best part about this is that I have charged it once and have not had to recharge it again in these past 3 months! Another great thing is that you don't have to replace any brush heads like I did with my other cleansing device and the back has little ridges that helps to massage in my serums deep into my pores. I also love the sleek design and that I can use it twice a day without bothering my sensitive skin. I highly recommend this cleansing device for anyone looking to get cleaner skin and a better skin routine.This is one of the best product for both cleanser and skin care apply tool Love this. If I didn't get the Luna for men then u should definitely get this second generationLove this! I wanted to get the LUNA 2 for oily skin, but wanted my LUNA to be the color black. The LUNA for Men 2 is the best of both worlds! Appears to be the same as the LUNA 2 for oily skin. 
 Works great! I have only been using it for a week and my skin has never felt cleaner! I can't wait to see the long term benefits of the cleansing and anti-aging modes.Bought it for my bf.
