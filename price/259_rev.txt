Very pleased with this purchase; I am a product junkie and grow tired of skin care products quickly, but have been using this regularly since the summer. My acne prone skin is so clear and luminous and I owe it to this product. I no longer get hormonal chin bumps and if I miss a few days of using this, my face gets a dullness that this rectifies. And the bottle is huge compared to 'ladies' serum. Highly recommend and hope Sephora continues to sell it.I took a chance on this product, never having heard of the company and knowing it was online only. I have not been disappointed. It's a good product. It smells good -- really clean -- and the smell disappears quickly. I'm a man, and I like that the smell isn't feminine. I'm also "older" and like the way it makes my aging skin look. I'll buy again.This may be made for a man, but I love this serum! It smells so good and fresh. It's lightweight and layers well under moisturizer. The biggest bonus is how much you get for the price. You get basically quadruple the amount of women's serums for the same price. Thanks pink tax. I hope this stays in stock at Sephora. It's my new favorite.I took a chance on this serum as there were no reviews when I bought it, and it's "online only" so I couldn't even sample inside a store first. DTRT, standing for "do the right thing" is a Korean skincare brand designed for men. I'm a woman, but figured I'd give it a try anyway. I have extreme combination skin, and so I was looking for a serum to apply just to my oily/acne prone forehead, nose and chin. (I apply a firming serum to my cheeks). I liked that this was described as "clarifying" and "brightening". Most of the serums at Sephora are $50-$100 for one ounce, and this is 4 ounces!
 I've been using this for about a month now and I'm happy with the results. My skin has never been clearer, with no new pimples. I don't think that this alone is a "cure for acne", but in combination with other good skincare products and dietary supplements, I think it's another helpful step. It's not irritating or drying and is actually soothing. This is definitely a keeper for me, and I will continue to use it.
 This is the only product I use from this brand. The other products don't really interest me, but I would be curious to see about any other new products they may introduce in the future.Very pleased with this purchase; I am a product junkie and grow tired of skin care products quickly, but have been using this regularly since the summer.
