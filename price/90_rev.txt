First thing about this is the smell. I didn't think much of it at first but after like 5 minutes it was almost unbearable. And since you just wipe it off the cent is there until you wash. Very perfumey or something just gave me a huge headache. Did not notice any difference from using the mask. While my skin felt moisturizer once I washed my face it felt normal again.First thing about this is the smell. I didn't think much of it at first but after like 5 minutes it was almost unbearable.
