Very lightweight, a little bit goes a long way, and rinses off very clean. Got a sample as well as everyone else and would love to repurchase as soon as I'm out, but the hefty price tag is holding me back. I'm sure that since the tiny bottle is lasting me so long, the full size would be worth it despite the cost. Noticed that it helps control my red and reactive skin. Not too sure about the bar counterpart, but this cleansing oil is amazing! 4 stars only because of the cost.Like everyone else, I got this as a sample with the bar and it's amazing! A little does go a long way and easily removes my make up without stripping my skin and the bar is nice as well. When my sample runs out I'm buying the full size because I'm sure it'll last forever which makes the price tag totally worth it!I received this as a sample along with its matching cleansing bar. It's awesome! I honestly wear ALOT of makeup like layers on layers and it always takes FOREVER to take my makeup off (I had literally tried everything also) this took my makeup and had me ready for bed in like 5-6 minutes. With the sample I've used it three times and it literally just takes a tiny bit so I'm sure this full size will last FOREVER.absolutely love this cleanser when used alongside the matching the bar. melts my make up away and gently cleans my skin without stripping it. received as a sample - will definitely be buying the full sizeVery lightweight, a little bit goes a long way, and rinses off very clean.
