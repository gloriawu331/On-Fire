Because I got a horrific infection from a pedicure a few years ago, I don't get them anymore. Not worth the risk. This set is just what I needed! I can't believe how much softer my feet are and how much progress I made on dry winter feet with just one use. The only thing is that the set didn't come with an instruction brochure. The instructions of how to use the complete set are on the package only, so I feel like I need to retain the box and I'd prefer to toss it.Didn't work for me, at all!!! Dry or wet, it just didn't work. And the charge? It pretty much only held charge for one foot, one section. Then recharge for I don't know how long, use on another section of your foot before it's completely drained again. I'm glad I was able to exchange it for something else.I had horrible looking feet before using the Pedi SMART. I especially like the metal buffer and peel. After three days of use, my feet looked as soft and beautiful as a baby's!I'm using the drug store spinning pedicure tools much more successfully. The metal disc that's supposed to remove callous really does nothing. I've tried every which way, even pushing hard, nothing. I love Clarisonic tools, but this one was a dog.I have been using this set for over a year. I use it twice a week. It is well worth the money. I am diabetic and the Dr. said she was very proud of the way I took care of my feet. When I went to get a pedicure, they were impressed with the softness of my feet and that I had no callouses.Because I got a horrific infection from a pedicure a few years ago, I don't get them anymore.
