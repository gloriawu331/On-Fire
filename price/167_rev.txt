I was debating between Tom Ford's Tuscan Leather and this. While Tom Ford's Tuscan Leather is more of a true leather scent (to me), the Acqua di Parma Leather is more bang for buck.
 The citrus notes are very potent in the beginning, but settle down within 30 minutes, leaving a very well-crafted leather fragrance that lasts 6 to 10 hours depending on the amount of sprays.Love Aqua Di Parma and so Wanted to love it. My hubby has colonia, oud, and the essenza, and I thought we'd love this too....wrong. It was just a weird citrus and leather and neither of us cared for it sooo it had to go back.We were at Walt Disney World’s Epcot Theme park in “Italy” when I sprayed this on my husband’s arm. We have been chased by it ever since. You walk away shaking your head when you see the price. But then it works its magic voodoo on you and you joke about selling the car to buy it or finding arguments against it because it’s more of a “night time” scent rather than a “daytime”. But the fragrance follows you into your dreams and you look it up on Sephora.com and see the satin lined box it comes in and you feel yourself losing your grip. That smoky, sexy, lying–naked-in-front-of- a- fireplace smell will defeat you. Be warned.I was debating between Tom Ford's Tuscan Leather and this.
