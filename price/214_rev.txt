This is very nice and high quality. For the price tag, I was hesitant on purchasing but if you do decide to get this, all I would recommend is go all in or nothing because the price point between the smaller size and the bigger one is a no brainer. KVD Pallet is still my fav when it comes to bronzing and contouring.I bought both Gold Dust and Terra. Terra is a great contour bronzer for lighter skin tones, while Gold Dust is more of a true bronzer, it has a little warmth to it, while Terra is a bit more cool. I have purchased everything from Too Faced to Chanel, and this is the best bronzer I have ever used. It gives a soft focus smoothing effect to the skin. I personally mix both Gold Dust and Terra to get an in-between shade, but love both bronzers! Highly recommend.I got mine in the shade Bronze Age during the 20VIB sale and I'm so glad I splurged on this bronzer. It blends like a dream and the color is just beautiful. If you want your face too look like you've been kissed by the sun during your Bahamas trip then get this shade! If you're looking for more of a contour then get Terra. Bronze Age leans warmer but doesn't make your face look like an orange. Terra is more cool toned and can really help create a natural contour. I'm planning to buy Terra once my wallet restocks with $$ lol. Add these shades ladies. You won't be disappointed. Splurge on yourself this Christmas!Absolutely gorgeous on light skin so smooth and buttery give a nice glow with the shimmer , its my new holy grail bronzer worth every pennyI have to be honest -- I own pretty much every bronzer out there Tarte, Charlotte Tilbury, Too Faced, Nars, Laura Mercier, Dolce & Gabbana, Dior, Chanel, by Terri ... You NAME it... Its in my makeup treasure chest... Then I was given this Bronzer as a Gift. I was very skeptical -- as I was assuming it was too orange-y too light... AND WAS I WRONG ... I have no idea what the folks at Tom Ford have put into this Bronzer -- but it is quite honestly is To Die For. I have never had such beautiful radiant skin w/ a very defined contour to accentuate it... Especially that doesnt make me look like I have a mask on. This is hands down the best. Its a stunner. I have it in both sizes. Definitely cannot live with out at this point. Cant even use the other shades I used to love. This is my go to.I received this as a generous gift from Tom ford Beauty and Sephora. Bronzer is something I never am really drawn to so this was a very good oppurtunity to try something out of my comfort zone. I am quite pleased with it now that I have finally gotten around to really testing this since it is now warm here. I am medium olive toned (nc37-40, nars st mortiz/stromboli) and although this is not a colour one would pick out for my skin tone, I find that the matte texture and cooler color is great for contouring lightly and shading around the face to give a slight sun kissed look..its so subtle and you really cant over do it with this powder. It is so smooth and finely milled..And with this large size I can't imagine ever running out! I am thankful to have received this , really worth the hype and investment..and the compact is beautiful as well!This bronzer is simply gorgeous! If you're looking for a natural glow this is the product you need. I was sceptical at first, but I don't regret this purchaseOMG! Im so happy i decided to pick this up, yes I was very skeptical about the bronzer showing up on my NC 44/45 tan skin. It is absolutely perfect its bendable and build able.. LUV IT.. And the package is to dye for...This is my first TF beauty product...I decided to splurge during the sale....and I must say I am quite impressed! Love the packaging and the color, terra, on my light skin tone. It's perfect for warming up the face and a light contour. If you want a defined contour you will need to bring in something else. I was even more surprised to find there was no fall out! Literally no fall out! I tried various brushes and various pressures and nada. I will say though, I think if I keep using my Wayne goss brush, soft natural hairs, it might create a hardened film over it. Not quite sure but will need to experiment to see if it does or if I imagined it. Also there is a scent, not fragrance which I am thankful for as a have sensitive skin, but the product does have a smell to it, not sure how to describe it. Nothing I can't live with as it only smells if you stick your nose in the pan, doesn't smell on the face. I wanted to get the blush/highlight/bronzer palette but it was out of stock, but I have no regrets with this purchase and expect that it will last me a long time!This comes in such a nice package . But that's just the beginning, it's a great bronzer very buildable and bendableTerra is a PERFECT contour/bronzer shade for my light/warm skin. For reference, my other favorites are CT Filmstar Bronze and Glow and Benefit Hoola. This is similar but very creamy and more buildable - its a dream to blend. For normal people the smaller size is probably fine, but if you're a bronzer lover the large size is a nice treat; especially during the VIB sale!This is very nice and high quality. For the price tag, I was hesitant on purchasing but if you do decide to get this, all I would recommend is go all in or nothing because the price point between the smaller size and the bigger one is a no brainer.

Bronzer is something I never am really drawn to so this was a very good oppurtunity to try something out of my comfort zone. I am quite pleased with it now that I have finally gotten around to really testing this since it is now warm here. I am medium olive toned (nc37-40, nars st mortiz/stromboli) and although this is not a colour one would pick out for my skin tone, I find that the matte texture and cooler color is great for contouring lightly and shading around the face to give a slight sun kissed look..its so subtle and you really cant over do it with this powder. It is so smooth and finely milled..And with this large size I can't imagine ever running out! I am thankful to have received this , really worth the hype and investment..and the compact is beautiful as well!This bronzer is simply gorgeous! If you're looking for a natural glow this is the product you need. I was sceptical at first, but I don't regret this purchaseOMG! Im so happy i decided to pick this up, yes I was very skeptical about the bronzer showing up on my NC 44/45 tan skin. It is absolutely perfect its bendable and build able.. LUV IT.. And the package is to dye for...This is my first TF beauty product...I decided to splurge during the sale....and I must say I am quite impressed! Love the packaging and the color, terra, on my light skin tone. It's perfect for warming up the face and a light contour. If you want a defined contour you will need to bring in something else. I was even more surprised to find there was no fall out! Literally no fall out! I tried various brushes and various pressures and nada. I will say though, I think if I keep using my Wayne goss brush, soft natural hairs, it might create a hardened film over it. Not quite sure but will need to experiment to see if it does or if I imagined it. Also there is a scent, not fragrance which I am thankful for as a have sensitive skin, but the product does have a smell to it, not sure how to describe it. Nothing I can't live with as it only smells if you stick your nose in the pan, doesn't smell on the face. I wanted to get the blush/highlight/bronzer palette but it was out of stock, but I have no regrets with this purchase and expect that it will last me a long time!This comes in such a nice package . But that's just the beginning, it's a great bronzer very buildable and bendableTerra is a PERFECT contour/bronzer shade for my light/warm skin. For reference, my other favorites are CT Filmstar Bronze and Glow and Benefit Hoola. This is similar but very creamy and more buildable - its a dream to blend. For normal people the smaller size is probably fine, but if you're a bronzer lover the large size is a nice treat; especially during the VIB sale!This is very nice and high quality. For the price tag, I was hesitant on purchasing but if you do decide to get this, all I would recommend is go all in or nothing because the price point between the smaller size and the bigger one is a no brainer. KVD Pallet is still my fav when it comes to bronzing and contouring.This is very nice and high quality.

KVD Pallet is still my fav when it comes to bronzing and contouring.I bought both Gold Dust and Terra. Terra is a great contour bronzer for lighter skin tones, while Gold Dust is more of a true bronzer, it has a little warmth to it, while Terra is a bit more cool. I have purchased everything from Too Faced to Chanel, and this is the best bronzer I have ever used. It gives a soft focus smoothing effect to the skin. I personally mix both Gold Dust and Terra to get an in-between shade, but love both bronzers! Highly recommend.This is very nice and high quality.

Highly recommend.I got mine in the shade Bronze Age during the 20VIB sale and I'm so glad I splurged on this bronzer. It blends like a dream and the color is just beautiful. If you want your face too look like you've been kissed by the sun during your Bahamas trip then get this shade! If you're looking for more of a contour then get Terra. Bronze Age leans warmer but doesn't make your face look like an orange. Terra is more cool toned and can really help create a natural contour. I'm planning to buy Terra once my wallet restocks with $$ lol. Add these shades ladies. You won't be disappointed. Splurge on yourself this Christmas!This is very nice and high quality.

You NAME it... Its in my makeup treasure chest... Then I was given this Bronzer as a Gift. I was very skeptical -- as I was assuming it was too orange-y too light... AND WAS I WRONG ... I have no idea what the folks at Tom Ford have put into this Bronzer -- but it is quite honestly is To Die For. I have never had such beautiful radiant skin w/ a very defined contour to accentuate it... Especially that doesnt make me look like I have a mask on. This is hands down the best. Its a stunner.

But that's just the beginning, it's a great bronzer very buildable and bendableTerra is a PERFECT contour/bronzer shade for my light/warm skin. For reference, my other favorites are CT Filmstar Bronze and Glow and Benefit Hoola. This is similar but very creamy and more buildable - its a dream to blend. For normal people the smaller size is probably fine, but if you're a bronzer lover the large size is a nice treat; especially during the VIB sale!
