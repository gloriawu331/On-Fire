What it is:A waterproof cleansing and antiaging device for men that deeply cleanses while improving the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles for radiant, firm, youthful-looking skin. 

What it is formulated to do:LUNA™ 2 cleansing and antiaging device deeply cleanses with up to 8,000 T-Sonic™ (transdermal sonic) pulsations per minute channeled through silicone touch-points. It smooths the appearance of lines and wrinkles with lower-frequency pulsationsleaving skin looking and feeling radiant, firmer, and more elastic while helping to improve absorption of your favorite skin care products.

What else you need to know:Bigger brush: the brush surface area is 40 percent larger than the LUNA’s, enabling it to cover a larger surface area of skin for more efficient cleansing in the same amount of time. It features a range of brush heads that are optimized to offer specialized cleansing, meeting the specific needs of different facial areas. 
Longer touch-points: for a remarkable balance of power and gentleness, the touch-points are 26 percent longer than the LUNA’s to allow for more flexibility when the touch-points make contact with the skin, preventing any pulling or stretching to preserve the skin’s natural elasticity. These ultra-long touch-points are also much narrower to reach areas of your face that are typically hard to cleanse.
Flexible brush head: the brush head that can bend up to 20 degrees further than the LUNA’s, curving against the skin which allows the touch-points to reach the many contours and angles of the face so that no area is left un-cleansed.    
Enhanced T-Sonic cleansing system: With 12 intensities and a motor that is twice as powerful, the pulsations dislodge more impurities from the pores, providing deeper cleansing and more effective antiaging while still remaining gentle on the skin. 
Thicker silicone: the silicone body is 36 percent thicker than the LUNA’s, making it plusher, smoother, softer, and easy to hold. It lowers the noise of the motor for a more relaxing skin care ritual while allowing the T-Sonic pulsations to travel into the skin’s surface for better results.
