This moisturizer is not worth half the price of the cost. I don't know how it's possible, but my skin has never been drier. The cost of this product is twice the cost of my regular product, but it is not even half as effective. This product left my skin extremely dry and made my pores look huge, by mid-day. When I initially apply it, my skin looks extremely greasy. I usually apply my primer fifteen minutes later, and have to apply twice as much to cover the greasy look. This product is very strongly scented. I'm devastatingly offended by how ineffective this product is.I had a friend try this cream and had experienced great results! I'm always hesitant to try new things from online....but it's an AMAZING cream. My skin has never felt so smooth!And there were none! A waste of $500. I returned both and repurchased Shiseido's Bio-Performance line.I work at a different cosmetic line, but my skin was in need of something we didn't have. I didn't know what I needed, but I wanted smooth, hydrated skin that didn't look damaged and rough. So I tried this ONCE. And my skin was so soft I couldn't stop touching it! It is expensive, but it's been a long time since something's turned my head. There's a price, but it can help slow the signs of aging. Can you really put a price on that?This moisturizer is not worth half the price of the cost. I don't know how it's possible, but my skin has never been drier.
