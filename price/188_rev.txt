I've never written a review on any products before but I feel like I need to help anyone else who is struggling with acne. The lancer method seriously worked and has been the only thing that has ever worked on my skin. I have tried everything from minocycline to differin to retina with only minimal results. The 3 blemish control steps have changed my skin. If you are desperate to clear up your acne please try this! It is 100% worth it! Lancer along with 5% glycolic acid from glyderm and Kate Somerville antibac cream are game changers!The results are fast and consistent! It is worth the money if you really wanna get rid of your acne. I suggest trying this out first and then investing in more lancer products like the polish methodExcellent results! Amazed at how good it feels to use this scrub on my face! I have previously been addicted to using Murad microdermabrasion exfoliator (pink tube) for getting rid of dead dry skin... but I think Lancer might just be an even more advanced formula when it comes to exfoliation. This truly tingles and is more coarse so if you have sensitive skin this might not be for you. (I have sensitive skin but I think using this every other day is okay without being too harsh) overall excellent results and feels like it's doing the job!Bought early November, and in the beginning was using every night and my skin was not happy with that so I started to use it every time my skin looked like it needed a little pick me up instead. So long story short it's a nice product but if you have sensitive/combination/rosacea skin use sparinglyI purchased the entire 3-step system about 2 months ago to test out. My skin is combination/oily, so following the instructions, I used the polish every night before cleansing and moisturizing. In the month and half I've been using it, I didn't see any noticeable differences, it just made my skin red and really sensitive. For the price, not worth it for me.I use it three times a day. It has improved my skin over a month of daily use. I had problematic skin. I apply it with my Clarisonic brush and it cleanses and exfoliates even better. It was suggested by a Lancer promoter at Sephora and I'm really thankful that she saw my skin issues and helped me purchase this product.i just switched over to this lancer line and am so far loving it. I think it's a great idea to have a polish, cleaner, and moisturizer as the step plan. this product has a peppermint scent which im not too keane on but it is really nice. very TINY grains and has a SLIGHT warming feeling (not as strong as some warming mask you may get). i don't think id use this product by itself but with the other products alongside it is a big win for me!I HAVE STRUGGLED MANY YEARS AS AN ADULT WITH HORRIBLE ACNE. WHEN I SAW THIS I SAID WELL IF IT DOES NOT WORK I CAN ALWAYS RETURN IT SEPHORA HAS SUCH A GREAT RETURN POLICY. THIS ONE IS DEFINITELY A KEEPER. I INITIALLY GOT THE NOURISH POLISH AND CLEANSER AND LOVED IT SO MUCH. AFTER ONLY USING THE THREE STEP REGIMEN FOR A WEEK, ALL MY ACNE HAS CLEARED UP. ITS BEEN OVER THREE WEEKS NOW AND STILL CLEAR SO I SAID WELL LET ME TRY THE BLEMISH POLISH AND I LOVE IT TOO. I SCRUB MY FACE AT THE START OF MY SHOWER AND LEAVE IT SIT TILL I RINSE MY CONDITIONER OUT OF MY HAIR THEN USE THE CLEANSE STEP. THE POLISH FEELS COOLING ON MY FACE AND CLEANS BEAUTIFULLY. IT HAS JUST ENOUGH SCRUB TO NOT DAMAGE YOUR FACE BUT YOU CAN TELL ITS EXFOLIATING ALL THE DEBRIS THAT IS PROBABLY CAUSING YOU TO BREAK OUT. I AM ALSO USING THE NOURISH MOISTURIZER AS WELL AND ITS BEEN GREAT HASN'T CAUSED ME TO BREAK OUT AS MOST ANYTHING THAT MOISTURIZES ME DOES. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS SYSTEM. I WILL BE STICKING TO THIS FROM NOW ON. FOUND MY HOLY GRAIL SYSTEM FOR SURE.I've never written a review on any products before but I feel like I need to help anyone else who is struggling with acne.
